Abstract 
 
Phishing is a significant problem for many organizations, as attackers often use 
deceptive tactics to trick people into revealing sensitive information like passwords 
or financial details. Shellphish and Wifiphisher are two powerful tools that 
demonstrate how easy it can be for attackers to launch phishing attacks. 
In this report, we'll explore these great tools used for phishing attacks and shed 
light on how phishing works. By understanding how these tools operate, we can 
better protect ourselves and our organizations from falling victim to such malicious 
schemes. Let's dive in and uncover the inner workings of phishing attacks.

Introduction 
 
Phishing is probably one of the biggest issues for most organizations today, with network 
and endpoint defensive technology getting better and better, the bad guys aren’t trying to go 
after the though route and instead of going for the low hanging fruit. Phishing is one of those 
issues where training the employees is your best defence – try your best to make sure they 
can spot a malicious email and make sure that they can report it easily so that appropriate 
action can be taken as quickly as possible. The train of thought behind saying this is that – 
it’s beneficial to depend on multiple nodes of human intelligence to spot a potential threat, 
because even if one person spots and reports a phishing mail, it’s possible to run mass 
searches and find who all were targeted by a campaign. 
Social engineering is a very interesting subject to think about, in this context, it is basically 
using the victim’s familiarity and habits against them. Human beings are creatures of habit, 
we are so used to certain things in our life that when faced with them, we don’t think twice 
before acting on them. As an example; we are aware that there are a lot of attempts to by 
hackers to compromise social media accounts, so if one receives an email from your 
preferred social media site that there was an attempt to break into your account or an email to 
review your accounts security settings, most people will click on the link and log into their 
account to check what’s going on. A hacker will use this against a victim, all they need to do 
is swap a real link with a malicious one.  
In the first part of this report, we'll delve into Shellphish, which is one of the easiest ways to 
generate a malicious link. Then, in the second part, we'll explore WIFIphisher, a powerful 
tool for demonstrating WIFI-Phishing attacks. 
Shellphish: A Phishing Tool 
 
Shellphish is an interesting tool that we came across that illustrates just how easy and 
powerful phishing tools have become today. The tool leverages some of the templates 
generated by another tool called SocialFish. The tool offers phishing templates for 18 popular 
sites, the majority are focused on social media and email providers. There is also an option to 
use a custom template if so desired. 
 
Installation 
 
Shellphish is fairly straight forward to install. It can be done on your Linux of choice; we will 
be using Kali. We fire up our Kali Linux and use the terminal to navigate to the desktop.

We need to clone the ShellPhish from GitHub, the download link is provided below. 
 
This makes a folder named “shellphish” on our desktop. Let’s check the folder and its 
contents. 
 
The next step is to change the permissions of the shellphish.sh file so that we as the admin 
can use it. We don’t want everyone to have open access to it. 
 
 
And that’s it, now we can launch our phishing tool 
 
cd Desktop 
git clone https://github.com/thelinuxchoice/shellphish.git 
ls 
cd shellphish/ 
ls 
chmod 744 shellphish.sh 
./shellphish.sh

Exploring Templates 
 
ShellPhish offers us 18 prebuilt templates, we will look through 3 of them to get an idea of 
what someone on the receiving end looks at when they get a link generated by this tool. 
Get the Instagram page. The platform needs no introduction. We can see what the malicious 
link leads to, the page it shows is very convincing and might easily fool someone who isn’t 
paying attention.

Similarly, you can generate another duplicate page i.e NETFLIX as shown below.

Weaponization for Twitter (X) 
 
Now we will see what the process of weaponizing a phishing link looks like. 
Once again, let’s start ShellPhish. 
 
ShellPhish gives us a multitude of templates to choose from, all we need to do is follow the 
prompts the tool gives us. 
We will choose the “Twitter template” for this demonstration. 
4 
We will be choosing option 2 here and using the Ngrok service to host our phishing link, this 
is what gives us the HTTPS on our phishing pages. Just by choosing this option, the tool 
starts a php and Ngrok server and we have our phishing link presented to us. 
2 
 
Now that we have our link, what do we do? What would a malicious actor do? 
We won’t put in too much work into what is about to happen next, it’s more so to 
demonstrate a process that is commonly used. The first thing we need is an email sent by 
Twitter to a user to make them aware of a suspicious attempt to log in to their account and 
./shellphish.sh

that they should secure their account by resetting their password. The catch here is that the 
user will first have to log into their account to reset their password. 
Here is our email that conveys good intentions. Notice the “Reset Password” button. 
 
We delete the “Reset Password” button, highlight where it says “password” in the “Secure 
your account by resetting your password now.”. 
Click on the “Insert Hyperlink” function given in the formatting bar. We copy the link given 
to us by ShellPhish in the Kali terminal. See the section in the terminal that says, “Send this 
link to the victim: https://f9935ff7.ngrok.io”. This link is pasted in the section that says, “Web 
address (URL)” and we click OK.

That’s it, we now have our weaponized email, ready to be sent to our victim

Phishing Attack 
 
The victim has received the weaponized email, The moment the “password” link is clicked, 
the ShellPhish tool starts showing signs of activity. We can see that the tool gives us certain 
details like the IP of the victim, the browser they are using, the country and the city they 
reside in, etc. 
Once the link is clicked, the victim is presented with a twitter page where they can enter their 
credentials to access their account so that they may change their password. We have 
volunteered to be the victim in this demonstration and are entering our account email 
“raj@gmail.com” and password “12345wetrtt”

The moment we click on the “Log in” button, we are redirected to the actual Twitter (X) site. 
Seems harmless right?

Now for the scary part, the credentials the victim entered have been ferried away to the 
malicious actor in plain text. Lo and behold! The tool proudly announces, “Credentials 
Found!”. 
You can see the account name and password in plain text. The thing that really stood out was 
the line that tells us the currency used in the country the victim resides in, we’ll leave it to 
you to figure out why that is. 
 
Declarations: This article is posted only for educational purpose to spread awareness among 
people from being trapped in Phishing attack.   
This tool shows us how easy phishing attacks have become to execute and depending on how 
determined a malicious actor is, there is a lot of creativity that they can put into making the 
email look as legitimate as possible. Just to give you an idea of how serious the issue of 
phishing is, according to a recent report – 3.4 billion fake emails are sent out daily! 
Email firewalls mostly depend on threat intel or on the strength of their filters which dictate 
how much scrutiny they exercise on each email that hits a domain and how quick they can be 
to deem an email malicious. 
The problem is that, if you don’t set the strength of these filters to a balanced setting, they 
will flag and block more emails than you would want, making the email firewall admins 
phone blow up. Not to mention the amount of business that will be hindered. 
So, that’s why internal human intelligence is a big tool at our disposal when it comes to 
spotting malicious emails. There are many free resources to educate your employees and 
peers on how to spot a malicious email, this is one of those resources and probably one of the 
best ones around – https://phishingquiz.withgoogle.com/

WiFi Exploitation with WifiPhisher 
 
 
Wifiphisher is a security tool that mounts automated victim-customized phishing attacks 
against WiFi clients in order to obtain credentials or infect the victims with malware. It is 
primarily a social engineering attack that unlike other methods it does not include any brute 
forcing. It is an easy way for obtaining credentials from captive portals and third-party login 
pages (e.g. in social networks) or WPA/WPA2 pre-shared keys. 
 
 
Requirement 
 
• 
Kali Linux. 
• 
Two WiFi adapter; one that supports AP mode and another that supports monitor 
mode. 
 
Wifiphisher Working 
 
After achieving a man-in-the-middle position using the Evil Twin or KARMA attack, 
Wifiphisher redirects all HTTP requests to an attacker-controlled phishing page. 
From the victim’s perspective, the attack makes use in three phases: 
1. The victim is being deauthenticated from her access point. Wifiphisher 
continuously jams all of the target access point’s WiFi devices within range by 
forging “De-authenticate” or “Disassociate” packets to disrupt existing associations. 
2. Victim joins a rogue access point. Wifiphisher sniffs the area and copies the target 
access point’s settings. It then creates a rogue wireless access point that is modeled by 
the target. It also sets up a NAT/DHCP server and forwards the right ports. 
Consequently, because of the jamming, clients will eventually start connecting to the 
rogue access point. After this phase, the victim is MiTMed. Furthermore, Wifiphisher 
listens to probe request frames and spoofs “known” open networks to cause automatic 
association. 
3. The victim is being served a realistic specially customized phishing page. 
Wifiphisher employs a minimal web server that responds to HTTP & HTTPS 
requests. As soon as the victim requests a page from the Internet, wifiphisher will 
respond with a realistic fake page that asks for credentials or serves malware. This

page will be specifically crafted for the victim. For example, a router config-looking 
page will contain logos of the victim’s vendor. The tool supports community-built 
templates for different phishing scenarios. 
Let’s start!!! 
Open the terminal in your Kali Linux and type the following command to download 
wifiphisher from GitHub. 
 
 
Once it gets downloaded, run the python file to install its setup and dependencies as shown 
below: 
 
 
Now run the script by typing wifiphisher on the terminal to launch a wifi-phishing attack 
which as similar as social engineering. 
git clone https://github.com/wifiphisher/wifiphisher.git 
cd wifiphisher/ 
python setup.py install

Here it will fetch all interfaces as shown in the given image and let an attacker choose any 
one ESSID/BSSID of the target network and try to trap victim by performing phishing. It will 
also perform both Evil Twin and KARMA attacks. 
From the list of the interface, I had targeted “iball-baton” to trap the victim connect from it. 
 
After that you will get 4 phishing scenarios to trap your target as given below: 
1. Firmware Upgrade page 
2. Network Manager connect 
3. Browser plugin update 
4. Oauth login Page 
Now let’s go through each phishing scenario one by one starting from the 1st option. 
Firmware Upgrade page: A router configuration page without logos or brands asking for 
WPA/WPA2 password due to a Firmware Upgrade page. 
 
Now when the victim will open his browser Firefox he will get a phishing page to upgrade 
the firmware that needs WPA/WPA2 password for installing a new version of firmware.

The victim may consider it as an official notification and go for upgrading by submitting his 
WIFI password. As the victim enter the password for WPA/WPA2 and click on start upgrade, 
he will get trap into a fake upgrade process.   
 
Following image is pretending to the victim that firmware is being upgraded don’t close the 
process until it completed while at the background the attacker has captured the WPA/WPA2 
password.

Great!! You can confirm the WPA/WPA2 password as shown in given below image, it is 
showing WPA –password: ram123456ram 
 
Once again repeat the same step to select ESSID. 
 
Now let us go through another phishing scenario from the 2nd option. 
Network Manager Connect: Imitates the behavior of the network manager. This templates 
show’s chrome “connection Failed” page and displays a network manager window through 
the page asking for the pre=shared key. Currently, the network managers of windows and 
Mac Os are supported.

Now when the victim will open browser, he will get a fake page for “connection failed” and 
moreover a fake window for the network manager. 
Here target will click on “connect” to reconnect with the interface. 
 
It asks to enter the password for connection with the selected interface while at the 
background the attacker will capture the WPA/WPA2 password.

Great!!  Again you can confirm the WPA/WPA2 password as shown in given below image, 
it has captured WPA –password: ram123456ram 
 
Repeat the same step to choose ESSID for the attack. 
 
Browser plugin update: A generic browser plugin update page that can be used to serve 
payloads to the victims. 
 
It will create a .exe payload and run multi handler in the background for reverse connection 
of the victim system. 
 
Now when the victim opens browser, he will get another fake page for Update plugins as 
shown in the given image. here is recommended to update the flash player which is 
outdated.    

 
 
Michael Tchuindjang

Page | 21  
 
 
Now when the victim will click on Update Now, it will start downloading an update.exe file 
into a victim’s system which is nothing but an exe backdoor file for making unauthorized 
access in his system. 
 
Awesome!! The attacker will get the reverse connection of the target’s system, from given 
below image you can see it has open meterpreter session 1.

Page | 22  
 
 
Repeat the same step to choose ESSID for the attack. 
 
Now move forward with its last option i.e. 4th option. 
OAuth Login Page: A free WIFI service asking for a Facebook credential to authenticate 
using OAuth. 
 
At this time when the victim will open a browser, he may get trap into phishing page set as 
“Get Connect to the Internet For free” as shown in the given image. 
So, when the victim will enter his Facebook credential for accessing free internet, he will get 
trap in that phishing attack.

Page | 23  
 
 
Here you can see a victim enters a username with password and click on the login for the 
Facebook connection he got an error message meanwhile attacker has capture victim’s 
Facebook credentials. 
 
Wonderful!! An attacker successfully traps the victim and fetched his Facebook account 
credential.
