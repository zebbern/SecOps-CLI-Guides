Abstract. LDAP Services are a key component in companies. The information stored in them 
is used for corporate applications. If one of these applications accepts input from a client and 
execute it without first validating it, attackers have the potential to execute their own 
queries and thereby extract sensitive information from the LDAP directory. In this paper a 
deep analysis of the LDAP injection techniques is presented including Blind attacks.

1. Introduction 
 
The amount of data stored in organizational databases has increased rapidly in recent years 
due to the rapid advancement of information technologies. A high percentage of these data is 
sensitive, private and critical to the organizations, their clients and partners. 
 
Therefore, databases are usually installed behind internal firewalls, protected with intrusion 
detection mechanisms and accessed only by applications. To access a database, users have to 
connect to one of these applications and submit queries through them to the database. The 
threat to databases arises when these applications do not behave properly and construct these 
queries without sanitizing user inputs first. 
 
Over 50% of web application vulnerabilities are input validation related, which allows the 
exploitation of code injection techniques. These attacks have proliferated in recent years 
causing severe security problems in systems and applications.  The SQL injection techniques 
are the most widely used and studied but there are other injection techniques associated with 
other languages or protocols such as XPath or LDAP. 
 
Preventing the consequences of these kinds of attacks, lies in studying the different code 
injection possibilities and in making them public and well known for all programmers and 
administrators. In this paper the LDAP injection techniques are analyzed in depth, because all 
the web applications based on LDAP trees might be vulnerable to these kinds of attacks. 
 
The key to exploiting injection techniques with LDAP is to manipulate the filters used to search 
in the directory services. Using these techniques, an attacker may obtain direct access to the 
database underlying an LDAP tree, and thereby to important corporate information. 
 
This can be even more critical because the security of many applications and services relies on 
single sign-on environments based on LDAP directories. 
 
Although the vulnerabilities that lead to these consequences are easy to understand and fix, 
they persist because of the lack of information about these attacks and their effects.  Though 
previous references to the exploitation of this kind of vulnerability exist the presented 
techniques don´t apply to the vast majority of modern LDAP service implementations. The 
main contribution of this paper is the presentation and deep analysis of new LDAP injection 
techniques which can be used to exploit these vulnerabilities. 
 
This paper is organized as follows: sections 2 and 3 explain the LDAP fundamentals needed to 
understand the techniques presented in the following sections. Section 4 presents the two 
typical environments where LDAP injection techniques can be used and exemplify these 
techniques with illustrative cases. Section 5 describes how BLIND LDAP Injection attacks can be 
done with more examples. Finally, in Section 6, some recommendations for securing systems 
against this kind of attack are given. 
 
2. LDAP Overview 
 
The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is a protocol for querying and modifying directory 
services running over TCP/IP. The most widely used implementations of LDAP services are 
Microsoft ADAM (Active Directory Application Mode) and OpenLDAP.

LDAP directory services are software applications that store and organize information sharing 
certain common attributes; the information is structured based on a tree of directory entries, 
and the server provides powerful browsing and search capabilities, etcetera. LDAP is object-
oriented, therefore every entry in an LDAP directory services is an instance of an object and 
must correspond to the rules fixed for the attributes of that object. 
 
Due to the hierarchical nature of LDAP directory services read-based queries are optimized to 
the detriment of write-based queries. 
 
LDAP is also based on the client/server model. The most frequent operation is to search for 
directory entries using filters. Clients send queries to the server and the server responds with 
the directory entries matching these filters. 
  
LDAP filters are defined in the RFC 4515. The structure of these filters can be summarized as: 
 
Filter = ( filtercomp ) 
Filtercomp = and / or / not / item 
And = & filterlist 
Or = |filterlist 
Not = ! filter 
Filterlist = 1*filter 
Item= simple / present / substring 
Simple = attr filtertype assertionvalue 
Filtertype = ”=” / ” ~ =”/ ”>=” / ”<=” 
Present = attr = * 
Substring = attr ”=” [initial] * [final] 
Initial = assertionvalue 
Final = assertionvalue 
 
All filters must be in brackets, only a reduced set of logical (AND, OR and NOT) and relational 
(=,>=,<=,~=) operators are available to construct them. The special character “*” can be used 
to replace one or more characters in the construction of the filters. 
 
Apart from being logic operators, RFC 4256 allows the use of the following standalone symbols 
as two special constants: 
 
- 
(&)  
-> Absolute TRUE 
- 
(|)  
-> Absolute FALSE 
 
3. Common LDAP environments 
 
LDAP services are a key component for the daily operation in many companies and institutions. 
Directory Services such as Microsoft Active Directory, Novell E-Directory and RedHat Directory 
Services are based on the LDAP protocol. But there are other applications and services taking 
advantage of the LDAP services. 
 
These applications and services used to require different directories (with separate 
authentication) to work. For example, a directory was required for the domain, a separate 
directory for mailboxes and distribution lists, and more directories for remote access, 
databases or web applications. New directories based on LDAP services are multi-purpose, 

LDAP Injection & Blind LDAP Injection

working as centralized information repositories for user authentication and enabling single 
sign-on environments. 
 
This new scenario increases the productivity by reducing the administration complexity and by 
improving security and fault tolerance. In almost every environment, the applications based on 
LDAP services use the directory for one of the following purposes: 
 
– Access control (user/password pair verification, user certificates management). 
– Privilege management. 
– Resource management. 
 
Due to the importance of the LDAP services for the corporate networks, the LDAP servers are 
usually placed in the backend with the rest of the database servers. Figure 1 shows the typical 
scenario deployed for corporate networks, and it is important to keep this scenario in mind in 
order to understand the implications of the injection techniques exposed in following sections. 
 
 
4. LDAP Injection in Web Applications 
 
LDAP injection attacks are based on similar techniques to SQL injection attacks. Therefore, the 
underlying concept is to take advantage of the parameters introduced by the user to generate 
the LDAP query. A secure Web application should sanitize the parameters introduced by the 
user before constructing and sending the query to the server. In a vulnerable environment 
these parameters are not properly filtered and the attacker can inject malicious code. 
 
 
 
Fig. 1. Typical scenario for an LDAP-based Web application 
 
Taking into consideration the structure of the LDAP filters explained in section 2 and the 
implementations of the most widely used LDAP: ADAM and OpenLDAP, the following 
conclusions can be drawn about the code injection. (The following filters are crafted using as 
value a non sanitized input from the user): 
 

LDAP Injection & Blind LDAP Injection 
 
 
Page: 5 of 17 
– (attribute=value): If the filter used to construct the query lacks a logic operator (OR 
or AND), an injection like ”value)(injected_filter” will result in two filters: 
(attribute=value)(injected_filter). In the OpenLDAP implementations the second filter 
will be ignored, only the first one being executed. In ADAM, a query with two filters 
isn´t allowed. Therefore, the injection is useless. 
 
- (|(attribute=value)(second_filter))    or   (&(attribute=value)(second_filter)): If the 
filter used to construct the query has a logic operator (OR or AND), an injection like 
“value)(injected_filter)” 
will 
result 
in 
the 
following 
filter: 
(&(attribute=value)(injected_filter)) (second_filter)). Though the filter is not even 
syntactically correct, OpenLDAP will start processing it left to right ignoring any 
character after the first filter is closed. Some LDAP Client web components will ignore 
the second filer, sending to ADAM and OpenLDAP only the first complete one, 
therefore allowing the injection.  
 
Some application frameworks will check the filter for correctness before sending it to 
the LDAP server. Should this be the case, the filter has to be syntactically correct, 
which can be achieved with an injection like: 
 “value)(injected_filter))(&(1=0” .This will result in two different filters, the second 
being ignored: (&(attribute=value)(injected_filter))(&(1=0)(second_filter)). 
 
As the second filter is going to be ignored by the LDAP Server, some components won´t 
allow an LDAP query with two filters. In these cases a special injection must be crafted 
in order to obtain a single-filter LDAP query. An injection like: “value)(injected_filter” 
will result in the following filter: (&(attribute=value)(injected_filter)(second_filter)). 
 
The typical test to know if an application is vulnerable to code injection consists of sending to 
the server a query that generates an invalid input. Therefore, if the server returns an error 
message, it is clear for the attacker that the server has executed his query and that he can 
exploit the code injection techniques. Taking into account the previous discussion, two kinds of 
environments can be distinguished: AND injection environments and OR injection 
environments. 
 
Fig. 2. LDAP injection

4.1. AND LDAP Injection 
 
In this case the application constructs the normal query to search in the LDAP directory with 
the “&” operator and one or more parameters introduced by the user. For example: 
 
(&(parameter1=value1)(parameter2=value2)) 
 
Where value1 and value2 are the values used to perform the search in the LDAP directory. The 
attacker can inject code, maintaining a correct filter construction but using the query to 
achieve his own objectives. 
 
4.1.1. Example 1: Access Control Bypass 
 
A login page has two text box fields for entering user name and password (figure 3). Uname 
and Pwd are the user inputs for USER and PASWORD. To verify the existence of the 
user/password pair supplied by a client, an LDAP search filter is constructed and sent to the 
LDAP server:  
 
(&(USER=Uname)(PASSWORD=Pwd)) 
 
If an attacker enters a valid username, for example, slisberger, and injects the appropriate 
sequence following this name, the password check can be bypassed. 
 
Making Uname=slisberger)(&)) and introducing any string as the Pwd value, the following 
query is constructed and sent to the server: 
 
(& (USER=slisberger)(&))(PASSWORD=Pwd)) 
 
 
Fig. 3. Login page with LDAP injection 
 
Only the first filter is processed by the LDAP server, that is, only the query 
(&(USER=slisberger)(&)) is processed. This query is always true, so the attacker gains access to 
the system without having a valid password.

4.1.2. Example 2: Elevation of Privileges 
 
For example, suppose that the following query lists all the documents visible for the users with 
a low security level: 
 
(&(directory=documents)(security_level=low)) 
 
 
Fig. 5. Low security level documents. 
 
Where “documents” is the user entry for the first parameter and low is the value for the 
second. If the attacker wants to list all the documents visible for the high security level, he can 
use an injection like “documents)(security_level=*))(&(directory=documents” resulting in the 
following filter: 
 
(&(directory=documents)(security_level=*))(&(directory=documents)(security_level=low)) 

LDAP Injection & Blind LDAP Injection 
 
 
Page: 8 of 17 
 
Fig. 6. All security levels documents 
 
The LDAP server will only process the first filter ignoring the second one, therefore, only the 
following query will be processed: (&(directory=documents)(security level=*)), while (& 
(directory=documents)(security level=low)) will be ignored. 
  
As a result, a list with all the documents available for the users with all security levels will be 
displayed for the attacker although he doesn’t have privileges to see them. 
 
 
4.2. OR LDAP Injection 
 
In this case the application constructs the normal query to search in the LDAP directory with 
the “|” operator and one or more parameters introduced by the user. For example: 
 
(|(parameter1=value1)(parameter2=value2)) 
 
Where value1 and value2 are the values used to perform the search in the LDAP directory. The 
attacker can inject code, maintaining a correct filter construction but using the query to 
achieve his own objectives.

4.2.1. Example 1:  Information Disclosure 
 
Suppose a resources explorer allows users to know the resources available in the system 
(printers, scanners, storage systems, etc…). This is a typical OR LDAP Injection case, because 
the query used to show the available resources is:  
 
(|(type=Rsc1)(type=Rsc2)) 
 
Rsc1 and Rsc2 represent the different kinds of resources in the system. In figure 7, 
Rsc1=printer and Rsc2=scanner to show all the available printers and scanners in the system. 
 
 
Fig. 7. Resources available to the user from the Resources Consoles Management 
 
If the attacker enters Rsc1=printer)(uid=*), the following query is sent to the server: 
 
(|(type=printer)(uid=*))(type=scanner)) 
 
The LDAP server responds with all the printer and user objects. 
 
 
Fig. 8. Information available to the attacker after the LDAP injection

5. Blind LDAP Injection 
Suppose that an attacker can infer from the server responses, although the application does 
not show error messages, the code injected in the LDAP filter generates a valid response (true 
result) or an error (false result). The attacker could use this behavior to ask the server true or 
false questions. These types of attacks are named “Blind Attacks”. Blind LDAP Injection attacks 
are slower than classic ones but they can be easily implemented, since they are based on 
binary logic, and they let the attacker extract information from the LDAP Directory. 
5.1. AND Blind LDAP Injection 
Suppose a web application wants to list all available Epson printers from an LDP directory 
where error messages are not returned. The application sends the following LDAP search filter: 
(& (objectClass=printer)(type=Epson*)) 
With this query, if there are any Epson printers available, icons are shown to the client, 
otherwise no icon is shown. If the attacker performs a Blind LDAP injection attack injecting 
“*)(objectClass=*))(& (objectClass=void“, the web application will construct the following LDAP 
query: 
(& (objectClass=*)(objectClass=*))(&(objectClass=void)(type=Epson*)) 
Only the first complete LDAP filter will process: 
(&(objectClass=*)(objectClass=*)) 
As a result, the printer icon must be shown to the client, because this query always obtains 
results: the filter objectClass=* always returns an object. When an icon is shown the response 
is true, otherwise the response is false. 
From this point, it is easy to use blind injection techniques. For example, the following 
injections can be constructed: 
(&(objectClass=*)(objectClass=users))(&(objectClass=foo)(type=Epson*)) 
(&(objectClass=*)(objectClass=resources))(&(objectClass=foo)(type=Epson*)) 
This set of code injections allows the attacker to infer the different objectClass values possible 
in the LDAP directory service. When the response web page contains at least one printer icon, 
the objectClass value exists (TRUE), on the other hand the objectClass value does not exist or 
there is no access to it, and so no icon, the objectclass value does not exist(FALSE). 
Blind LDAP injection techniques allow the attacker access to all information using TRUE/FALSE 
questions. 
 
 

LDAP Injection & Blind LDAP Injection 
 
 
Page: 11 of 17 
5.2. OR Blind LDAP Injection 
In this case, the logic used to infer the desired information is the opposite, due to the presence 
of the OR logical operator. Following with the same example, the injection in an OR 
environment should be: 
(|(objectClass=void)(objectClass=void))(&(objectClass=void)(type=Epson*)) 
This LDAP query obtains no objects from the LDAP directory service, therefore the printer icon 
is not shown to the client (FALSE). If any icon is shown in the response web page then, it is a 
TRUE response. Thus, an attacker could inject the following LDAP filters for gathering 
information: 
(|(objectClass=void)(objectClass=users))(&(objectClass=void)(type=Epson*)) 
(|(objectClass=void)(objectClass=resources))(&(objectClass=void)(type=Epson*)) 
5.3. Exploitation example 
In this section, an LDAP environment has been implemented to show the use of the injection 
techniques explained above and also to describe the possible effects of the exploitation of 
these vulnerabilities and the important impact of these attacks in current systems security.  
In this example the page printerstatus.php receives a parameter idprinter to construct the 
following LDAP search filter: 
(&(idprinter=Value1)(objectclass=printer)) 
5.3.1. Discovering Attributes 
Blind LDAP Injection techniques can be used to obtain sensitive information from the LDAP 
directory services by taking advantage of the AND operator at the beginning of the LDAP 
search filter built into the web application.  For example, given the attributes defined for the 
printer object shown in figure 9 and the response web page of this LDAP query in figure 10 for 
Value1=HPLaserJet2100, 
Fig. 9. Attributes defined for the printer object 

LDAP Injection & Blind LDAP Injection 
 
 
Page: 12 of 17 
 
Fig. 10. Normal behavior of the application 
an attribute discovering attack can be performed by making these following LDAP injections: 
 (&(idprinter=HPLaserJet2100)(ipaddress=*))(objectclass=printer)) 
Fig 11: Response web page when the attribute does not exist 
( & (idprinter=HPLaserJet2100)(department=*))(objectclass=printer)) 
 
Fig 12: Response web page when the attribute exists 

LDAP Injection & Blind LDAP Injection 
 
 
Page: 13 of 17 
Obviously, the attacker can infer from these results which attributes exist and which do not. In 
the first case, the information about the printer is not given by the application because the 
attribute ipaddress does not exist or it is not accessible (FALSE). On the other hand, in the 
second case, the response web page shows the printer status and therefore, the attribute 
department exists in the LDAP directory and it is possible access to it. 
Furthermore, with blind LDAP injection attacks the values of some of these attributes can be 
obtained. For example, suppose that the attacker wants to know the value of the department 
attribute: he can use booleanization and charset reduction techniques, explained in the next 
sections, to infer it. 
5.3.2. Booleanization 
An attacker can extract the value from attributes using alphabetic or numeric search. The crux 
of the idea is to transform a complex value (e.g. a string or a date) into a list of TRUE/FALSE 
questions. This mechanism, usually called booleanization, is summarized in figure 13 and can 
be applied in many different ways. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 13. Booleanization 
Suppose that the attacker wants to know the value of the department attribute. The process 
would be the following:  
( & (idprinter=HPLaserJet2100)(department=a*))(objectclass=printer)) 
 
Fig. 14. FALSE. Value doesn´t start with ‘a’

(&(idprinter=HPLaserJet2100)(department=f*))(objectclass=printer)) 
 
Fig. 15. TRUE. Value starts with ‘f’ 
(&(idprinter=HPLaserJet2100)(department=fa*))(objectclass=printer)) 
 
Fig. 16. FALSE. Value doesn´t start with ‘fa’ 
(&(idprinter=HPLaserJet2100)(department=fi*))(objectclass=printer)) 
 
Fig. 17. TRUE. Value starts with ‘fi’ 

LDAP Injection & Blind LDAP Injection 
 
 
Page: 15 of 17 
As shown in figure 9, the department value in this example is financial. The first try with the 
character ‘a’ does not obtain any printer information (figure 14) therefore, the first character 
is not an ’a’. After testing with the rest of the characters, the only one that obtains the normal 
behavior from the application is ’f’ (figure 15). Regarding the second character, the only one 
that results in the normal operation of the application is ’i’ (figure 17) and so on. Following the 
process, the department value can be obtained. 
This algorithm can be also used for numeric values. In order to perform this, the 
booleanization process should use ‘greater than or equal to’ (>=) and ‘less than or equal to’ 
(<=) operators. 
5.3.3 Charset Reduction 
An attacker can use charset reduction to decrease the number of requests needed for obtain 
the information. In order to accomplish this, he uses wildcards to test if the given character is 
present *anywhere* in the value, e.g.: 
(&(idprinter=HPLaserJet2100)(department=*b*))(objectclass=printer)) 
 
Fig. 18. FALSE. Character ’b’ is not in the department value 
( & (idprinter=HPLaserJet2100)(department=*n*))(objectclass=printer)) 
 
Fig. 19. TRUE. Character ’n’ is in the department value 

LDAP Injection & Blind LDAP Injection 
 
 
Page: 16 of 17 
Figure 18 shows the response web page when the character ’b’ is tested: no results are sent 
from the LDAP directory service so no letter ‘b’ is present, but in figure 19 a normal response 
web page is shown, meaning that the character ’n’ is in the department value.  
Through this process, the set of characters comprising the department value can be obtained. 
Once the charset reduction is done, only the characters discovered will be used in the 
booleanization process, thereby decreasing the number of requests needed. 
 
6. Securing Applications against Blind LDAP Injection & LDAP Injection 
attacks 
 
The attacks presented in the previous sections are performed on the application layer, 
therefore firewalls and intrusion detection mechanisms on the network layer have no effect on 
preventing any of these LDAP injections. However, general security recommendations for LDAP 
directory services can mitigate these vulnerabilities or minimize their impact by applying 
minimum exposure point and minimum privileges principles. 
 
Mechanisms used to prevent code injection techniques include defensive programming, 
sophisticated input validation, dynamic checks and static source code analysis. The work on 
mitigating LDAP injections must involve similar techniques. 
 
It has been demonstrated in the previous sections that LDAP injection attacks are performed 
by including special characters in the parameters sent from the client to the server. It is clear 
therefore that it is very important to check and sanitize the variables used to construct the 
LDAP filters before sending the queries to the server. 
 
In conclusion, we see that parentheses, asterisks, logical (AND “&”, OR “|” and NOT “!”) and 
relational (=,>=,<=,~=) operators must be filtered at the application layer. 
 
Whenever possible, values used to construct the LDAP search filter must be checked against a 
list of valid values in the Application Layer before sending the query to the LDAP server.
