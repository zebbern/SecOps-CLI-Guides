Wireshark 
A popular tool for recording and analyzing network traffic in real time is Wireshark, a network 
protocol analyzer. It is a free, open-source program that works with Linux, macOS, and Windows, 
among other operating systems. An effective tool for cybersecurity investigation, performance 
optimization, and network troubleshooting is Wireshark. 
 
Wireshark is a potent network analysis tool that supports multiple protocols, including HTTP, TCP, 
UDP, and DNS, and records data packets moving over wired or wireless network interfaces in 
real time. For in-depth protocol study, it decodes packets into a structured, readable format. To 
concentrate on particular traffic, users can filter and search packets according to IP addresses, 
protocol types, or port numbers. It makes it possible to effectively monitor network performance 
and traffic flow with visualization tools including flow graphs, I/O graphs, and comprehensive data. 
Wireshark is an essential tool for network troubleshooting and security investigation since it is 
extensible through scripts and plugins and allows offline analysis by exporting packets in common 
formats like PCAP and PCAPNG. 
 
Real-World Uses:  
● IT Support: Resolving client or staff connectivity problems. 
● Cybersecurity: Keeping an eye out for weaknesses or efforts at incursion.  
● DevOps: Improving service-to-service connectivity in a microservices framework. 
● Education: imparting knowledge on cybersecurity and networking concepts.

Tips for Specific Analysis Scenarios 
Scenario 
Filter or Approach 
Detect Port 
Scanning 
Filter for packets with many destination ports: ip.src == 192.168.1.1 
&& tcp.flags.syn == 1

Analyze Slow 
Connections 
Look for retransmissions or high latency: 
tcp.analysis.retransmission or I/O Graphs. 
Identify Suspicious 
Traffic 
Filter for unusual IPs or unknown protocols: !(ip.addr == <trusted 
network>). 
Examine Downloads Follow the HTTP Stream or use http.file_data to view file contents. 
Inspect ARP 
Spoofing 
Look for duplicate ARP responses: arp.duplicate-address-frame.
