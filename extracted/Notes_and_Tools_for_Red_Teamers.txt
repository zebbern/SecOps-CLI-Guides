He likes finding thin client RCEs and examining buffer overflows on binaries using his <IDR??> Tool,
mostly because hardly any hackers are looking in this area https://youtu.be/-A0S2AkCLFg?t=1158
This guy covers a lot of pretty basic things and appears to try and appeal to and please a driven yet
younger/inexperienced crowd, but he has these moments where he just 'pops off' and starts spitting
some fire :fire: knowledge and information :book:. Those moments along wi his positive attitude and
postive really makes him appealing and oooov
He explains CVE vs CWE really well here

#My Automated Methodology (WIP)
1. After Getting subdomains, run technology scan (whatweb? Nuclei? Other?) and if it detects
certain stacks, (wordpress, graphql) then automatially recon those and alert discord or telegram

etc. Also, js vulns alert. Basically automate the checking

Summary Mind Map For his analysis of www.tesla.com Content Discovery
1. Tech Browser Extensions
2. Pre-manual Testing and Automation - Scanners (DID NOT RUN) Nuclei, Jaeles, Portscan Naabu
(Standard ports OPEN)
3. Content Discovery - Wordlist - Seclists-Discovery/URLS/urls-drupal-7-20.txt Wordlist2: Raft,
HTTParchive_directories, onelistforall, content_discovery_all
4. Gau | Trashcompactor wordlistgen
5. Parsed Mobile Questions
6. How does the app pass data? Hybrid: Params and API
7. How/Where does the app talk about users? It didn't directly have a UID on tesla.com but tightlyh
integrated into tesla.com was shop.tesla.com which had this endpoint (He searched burp history
for uuid and uid and found ) http://shop.tesla.com/user-status.json
{
  "signed_in": "true",
  "emailId": "jhaddix@gmaiol.com"
}
8. Does the site have multi-tenancy or user levels? Framework - Yes - Drupal should have admin
role API - Yes, api should be tested for access and auth as it could return other users data
9. Does it have a unique threat model? Not for Tesla.com but possibly through mobile (does things
with the car, can control the roof etc)

10. How does the site handle XSS? output is encoded per drupal rules on telsa.com still need to
check api
11. How does the site handle CSRF? Token in Header, applied everywhere so far. Need to test API
and Shop
12. Has the site had any past writeups / exploits? 2014 sqli twitquark.com/so/tesla-sqli-2014 (make
sure ot include links) 2022 DOM XSS bugcrowd.com/disclosures/xss/3232332 2021 uploaded

Heatmap - Profile Sections
41:57 Heat Mapping
Heat Mapping Mind Map He keeps this up on his desktop to remind him about where he wants
to look and what he wants to look at
6 areas he looks
File Uploads very first - (usually vulnerable to injection, cross site scripting, xxe, ssrf, trick it to
shell a server depending on the tech stack / parser, and determine where / how the data is
stored for the application.
Content Types
He filters burp looking by all the returned content looking for 'multipart forms'. He has
it outlined in RED because he has never met a multipart form that was secure. Bet.
Whether you're shelling it, doing an injection
He looks for Content-Type XML for XXE
He looks for Content-Type JSON for api vulns
APIs
Hidden Methods / endpoints
Lack of auth
Profile

APp custom fields
Integrations
SSRF, XXE

2. Nehamsec
https://github.com/fuzz-security?tab=repositories
He sets up his ubuntu box using his BBHT Repo
He runs Directory Brute forcing because everytime he finds a new host, automatically he runs
directory brute forcing on it, just to make sure he finds all the juicy files and folders. He uses
Dirsearch as shown here

3. Tomnomnom
Tomnomnom Methodology
Live Recon and Automation on Shopify's Bug Bounty Program with @TomNomNom
Assetfinder & wildcards file

He gathers the wildcard from their scope into wildcards  then runs assetfinder  then he goes and
finds subdomains. cat wildcards | assetfinnder --subs-only | anew domains
If your subdomains end up containing characters at the front of them like -cisco.shopify.com , a
nice low tech way to clean them is to sort  (: sort  in Vim) and then pop to the end ( G  in Vim)
so any special characters will go down to the end (I suppose a reverse sort would make them at
the beginning) making it easy to trim them out and get rid of any lines beginnig with a *  and
so on. He keeps the ones starting with _  like _dev.shopify.com .
Httprobe --prefer-https & hosts file
To find what's listening he uses httprobe with a concurrency of 80 'or something like that' Final
command here cat domains | httprobe -c 80 --prefer-https | anew hosts  he does that to see what
respoods on port 443 or 80. He wrote into Httprobe the ability to prefer-https with the --prefer-
https  flasg.
Anew
Previously before anew he would use tee -a . A common use case him is he has a file of domains
and he didn't want to have to de-duplicate them all the time, so he created anew . He uses a few
different tools to look for domains e.g. assetfider , findomain . anew  only adds nenw lines to the
file, it works works similar to tee -a  except if a line already exists in a file, it doesn't add it. It also
outputws what the new lines were so you know what it is adding to the file if thats where stdout is
putting the output.x
Starts here
findomain -f wildcards | tee -a findomain.out  and then cat findomain.out | anew domains |
httprobe -c 50 | anew hosts
If he was to Httprobe the output of findomain  before ran anew on them against the domains file
which ensures only non duplicate hosts will be displayed as output, then it would run httprobe for ALL
of them raher on unique domains. A cool tip to keep the noise low. This highlights a problem with
anew / this workflow in my opinion, if something happened (a typo in the command, commad
recieved a error code response it can't handle, etc) then httprobe might not get ran and anew would
cover up the problem on accident.

Methodology Notes #1 - Katie Explains - My Methodlogy
She clicks all the buttons always. She prefers to understand every tool and have a precise reason
and goal for usage. Did I mention Click ALL the buttons? Click all the buttons. Make sure you've
tried good ol' press all the buttons.
API Enumeration / Burp Intruder
Copy & Paste into Burp Intruder
Identify Interesting Endpoints - Learning to recognize interesting endpoits
takes lots of time as a developer or lots of time hackinng. Rely on your
intuition
Things to look for - signs of interesting endpoints
ID = IDOR
Sequential? (ids?)
Reflected Input = XSS
Complex Processes = Busiess Logic
Lots of Data = Information Exposure
Wordlists Public / API / Custom wordlists
API Wordlists - A wordlist of API Names used for fuzzing web application APIs. When do we use
wordlists? 2 main times in API recon specifically
When we want to enumerate resources to find new endpoints When we want to enumerate
paramters to find additional functionarlity Often this require 2 different Wordlists!
1. Public wordlists
1. Seclists (API Specific)
2. Fuzzdb (API Specific)
3. Seclists raft words (list of words)
2. Manual Wordlists
Similar services might have documented APIS - check for those
Or use the waybackmachine method on those API's (nehamsecs videos)
Make sure you've tried good old press all the buttons Then start writing sensible words

What does the app say?
What actions does it let you do?
/api/v1/profile
/api/v1/users
/api/v1/posts
/api/v1/answers
DEMO: Enumeration API Endpoints using ffuf and Burp Intruder Scenario: Starting on a new webpage,
we don't see much other than a login page. There is not much content to click on. Staring at you is a
login. Finally, you check burp. You see /api/users/6  in a BURP web request. Let the fun begin!
1. In burpsuite send an API request you want to fuzz to Intruder.
2. Remove the existing API function call and replace it with the two SS Characters for each text file
you want to use
3. On the 'Positions' tab, set Attack type to 'Cluster Bomb'
4. On the Payloads tab, select 1 for the first payload set drop-dow then select a payload type of
"Runtime file" and navigate to the driectory you downloaded these text files to, select
"Actions.txt"

(00) Project Tracking
Take notes with Xmind. He finds Acquisitionos with Crunchbase. The he finds ASN numbers for all
acquisitions found manually with bgp.he.net
(01) Finding Seeds/Roots
You can use [asnlookup] or [metabigor]
ASN - The Autonomous System Number is a reference to their entire IP Space. A 'Reference
Identifier' for all of their Registered Ips/IP Space. Collecting ASNs maually can be important so
you don't accidently enumerate over an asset that is NOT in scope, or more in particular of a
wrong target altogether.

Take for instance he searched for "Office" and it came up with Office Depot Europe B.V and
Office Depot (as it should.) It also came up with "The Office of fhe President". Which... you
probably don't want to be enumerating willy Nilly!
Amass - Run amass on the found ASNs amass intel -asn 138603 -config
$HOME/.config/amass/config.ini
Whoxy - While Amass is running he runs the company through whoxy. You can get a free api key
through Whoxy. There are many Reverse "Who Is" databases find the one you like.
Domlink - give it your api key and your domain and it will find everything for the 'company' and
'email' and all the related domains
He uses the search engine tool Shodan  to glean a valuable question: is twitch.amazon.eu  (Found
prevously using ______) relevant to our testing? Example: `https://www.shodan.io/search?
query=twitch.tv
5. ZSeano
Zseano Methodology 1
Live Recon on Rockstar Games With @zseano​
He created bugbountyhunter.com Where he personally triages bugs you submit.
His Recon is "Figuring out how things work". He will be doing Recon on Rockstar Games. Before he
does anythig he reads writeups. In the case of Rockstart Games he noticed a lot of XSS and Open
basic vulnerabilities. That says to him that he should just go checkout the webapp and see how it
works and log some requests.

Burp, Collaborator, bappstore
Amass, httprobe, aquatone, anew, dnsgen, ffuf
Seclists, Commonspeak, Inputscanner, Linkfinder, Parameth, Mhmdiaa, Anychange
Process for testing for XSS & filtering:
Step One: Testing different encoding and checking for any weird behaviour Test <h1><img>
<table>  |-> If it is reflected as < or %3C then try for double encodings like %253C and %26lt; |(
TIP ) => https://d3adend.org/xss/ghettoBypass Some interesting encodings to try can be
This step is about finding out what's allowed and isn't & how they handle our payload. For
example if <script>  was reflected as <script>, but %26lt;script%26gt; was reflected as
<script> , then I know I am onto a bypass and I can begin to understand how they are handling
encodings (which will help me in later bugs maybe!). If not matter what you try you always see
<script> or %3Cscript%3E then the paramerer in question may not be vulnerable.
Issues he finds
He first Starts with XSS to get a feel for the overall security of the app. By testing the filters, you can
see what parameters are filtered and what is let through. The interestinng thing about his
methodology is you know the site is vulnerable, but the filters were put into place by the developers
to stop you from exploting it. The thinking behind that is it means even i f the
[Burp](Burp Suite | https://support.portswigger.net) - Burp Collaborator |

DNSGen | If you want to be really thorough and possibly even find some gems, dnsgen by Patrik
Hudak (https://github.com/ProjectAnte/dnsgen) works brilliantly: cat amass-output.txt | dnsgen
- | httprobe  1
ffuf | To discover files and directories, FFuF (https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) is by far the fastest and
most customisable, it’s worth reading all the documentation, however for basic usage: ffuf -ac
-v -u https://domain/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt.
Wordlists – Every hacker needs a wordlist and luckily Daniel Miessler has provided us with “SecLists”
(https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/) which contains wordlists for every type of scanning you
want to do. Grab a list and start scanning to see what you can find. As you continue your hunting
you'll soon realize that building your own lists based on keywords found on the program can help aid
you in your hunting. The Pentester.io team released “CommonSpeak” which is also extremely useful
for generating new wordlists, found here: https://github.com/pentester-io/commonspeak. A detailed
post on using this tool can be found at https://pentester.io/commonspeak-bigquery-wordlists/

If runing on a domain with a lot of hosts run using the screen  command.
Bugbounty recon Automation using bash | Automate your complete recon | @CyberUF
He walks us through setting up a short script (3-4 lines) Here is the basic outline wd:
File: recon.sh
#!/bin/bash
domain=$1
if [[ -z  $domain ]];
then
echo -e "Usage ./recon.sh <domain>"
exit 1
fi
mkdir "$domain"
He then Enumereates over subdomains using Subfinder .

echo -e "Enumerating subdomains for "$1""
subfinder -d "$domain" -silent > "  $domain"/subs.txt
You can run it using chmod u+x /path/to/recon.sh  and then calling it ./recon.sh google.com .
Next he gets all the live subdomains using Httpx.
echo -e "Enumerating Live Subs for "$1""
cat "$domain"/subs.txt | https -title -tech-detect -status-code > "$domain"/live-subs.txt
Next he gets all Urls for the target.
echo -e "Enumerating All Urls for "$1""
cat "$domain"/live-subs.txt | waybackurls > "$domain/All-urls.txt"
To test his script at this point he comments out httpx because it takes the longest to run out of the all.
This is he end of his Part 1. He is going to release the next part to this in a week which I will post the
notes on here. He Notes how you can easily add onto this any of the subdomain enumeration tools
like Shodan etc.

Mass Hunt XSS with and without GF Patterns
Video
From Here He has over 99 GF Patterns. List is there. Get a list of them when you need ideas.
He found 136 links. After GF Patterns, it was 36. The point is, GF patterns can greaty limit you when
hunting for xss aka paramters. If you grep by "=" you will find way more.
curl --path-as-is --insecure "$HOST" | grep -qs "<script>confirm(1)" && echo "$HOST \033[0;31m
erable\n" || echo "$HOST" \033[0;32mNot Vulnerable\n";done
First Iteration
waybackurls $HOST | tee testphp1.txt | gf xss | egrep -iv ".(jpg|jpeg|gif|css|tif|png|ttf|woff
With GF
waybackurls $HOST | tee testphp1.txt | grep '=' | egrep -iv ".(jpg|jpeg|gif|css|tif|png|ttf|wo
Without GF
```bash
waybackurls $HOST | tee testphp1.txt | grep '=' | qsreplace '"><script>confirm(1)</script>' |

### The Mass Hunt XSS Technique Bug Bounty Hunters don't want you to know
[[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWtradkn3Vo)]  by Hacktify Cyber Security
In a previous video he [came up](https://youtu.be/FWtradkn3Vo?t=122) with the following payloa

```bash
waybackurls testphp.vulnweb.com | tee testphp1.txt | grep "=" | egrep -iv ".(jpg|jpeg|gif|css|
He broke this video down into two parts.
1st part - as experienced xss hunters know, in order to find XSS, we need to find parameters. We have
all paramters from waybackurls  with the help of gf  xss patterns / grep "="  works as well to find
them. Doing an egrep -iv  clears the clutter. When we have the parameters, we just need to check if
they reflect special characters.
1. Need to check special chars
If special characters are not filtered, and they do reflect back into the response, we confirm the need
to put an xss payload in it.
After we have done this step, we are going to narrow down the scope from say 500 to 50 so we send
less requests. So now that we have identified special parameters and narrowed our scope down, it's
time to come up with a valid xss payload.
2. Valid xss Payload
It will put dynamic xss payloads to this narrowed down scope, and only send a valid xss payload to
those that are not filtering special parameters.
Essentially, we are being nice to the server and not triggering the WAF.
cat testphpwayback.txt --> read the file
| kxss --> filter special chars
| sed 's/=.*/=/' --> remove everythig after =, add =
| sed 's /URL: //' --> remove URL: and white space
| dalfox pipe --> dalfox tool for xss payload
-b https://me2.xss.ht --> BXSS payload adder.
Read the output of s
After Dalfox pass all urlss to Dalfox usin pipeline mode

Information Gathering
What is:- Reconnaissance (Recon) is an imporant tenchinque for penetration testing and the
beginnning point of many data breaches. It involves gathering of information about the target which
can be useful for finding flaws or vulnerabilities. Many people never do proper reconnaissance and
start attacking the targest which is a wrong way.
Step 1: Choose a Target. He uses Google Dorking to find a program.
responsible disclosure powered by bugcrowd
Tools To Gather Information
Subfinder => to find the Subdomains
Httpx
Waybackurls
cat domains.txt | waybackurls > urls
Dalfox
Subfinder Syntax
Https
Google Dorks
Google Dorking is justs an advanced technique that is used to search Google's index in a better
way. Using this technique you can do a lot of things. You can search for a very specific query or
find someone's email and even passwords.
Next he highlights some powerful dorks. Dork #1:

Google foo is important and awesome https://youtu.be/GeNJvOvzVSk?t=3987
He almsot always starts with dirsearch. If the 401 page is coming back for everything he switches to
TurboIntruder so he can write python and process it Protip from here Always try going to
site.com/site, where the directrory folder name is the same as the subdomain name.
He always starts with dirsearch and whenever the return code is odd like 401 for everything that is
when he will move to other tools like Turbo Intruder so he has more control over things. He uses
them for content discovery for Content Discovery. He like how you can use Python to determine what
your ouput looks like with turbointruder here
he has a script he did research on and doesn't want you to run it on synact but anywhere else is fine!
Good idea to find that research it sounds legit.

How to Use Amass Efficiently by by @jeff_foley #NahamCon2020 )
51:37 -So how can I make Amass go faster? You will need to set`-max
You use the -rf  flag to set the resolvers to use. However, yyou need to keep in mind or take into
account that the maximun number of DNS request queries that Amass is going to send out at any
given moment is also that same number you gave to -rf. So, if you only change the
He literally 'pulls assetfinder' into his script as a library of sorts.

Automating Basic Authorization and Digest Authentication
Loggin in Automatically with Zap
Challenge Labs - Basic Authenticion In basic authorization, the server sends a HTTP Response Header
www-authenticate  to signal that the resource is protected behind Basic Authorization.
www-authenticate: Basic realm="test"
Then when accessing the lab and usingthe supplied guest:guest  credentials, you see a HTTP Request
Header is sent, and set to
Authorization: Basic Z3Vlc3Q6Z3Vlc3Q=
That's all find and dandy but we want to do that automatically tomake things easier. Everything is
done through contexts. So he is going to
1. right click the url (The request with the Authorization Header) and include it in The Default
Context.
2. Then go to Session Management and change it from Cookie Based to HTTP Authentication
Session Management.
3. Then, go to the Authentication Page and change it from Manual to HTTP/NTLM.
4. Then fill in the Hostname with 'jigsaw.w3.org' and the port to 443 and the Realm with "test" as
the header specifiedi (he did not add the realm.)
5. Add the username and password as 'guest'. The first Username up top is how it displays in Zap,
the other one is the actual username.
             That should be all the info we need. Though, if we actually go in and right c

hacking simplified and Tess #good one his amass command
his nuclei command
his amass -> httpx command

his ffuf command here
ffuf -c -u https:/au.conv.indeed.com/FUZZ -mc Actually his ffuf command here
7:45 - Amass is his go-to subdomain scanner, followed by httpx 20:00 - His Nuclei Command 26:30 -
If he finds a 302 and it's a vhost ( httpx -sc  -vhost )
27:00 - Enumerating 302 with ffuf
27:30 - One4all Wordlist - onelistforallshort.txt
28:00 - Github English Words Wordslist words_alpha.txt
28:30 - Using English words wordslist to fuzz for WORD.html and WORD.zip 32:00 - His Nuclei
Template for same problem he solved. 40:30 - His Puredns command
As he states quite a few times, he's obsessed with finding subdomains. but it also turns out it's his
'hacking superpower'. He says it is what seperates him. He doesn't manual hakc. He sends that to
other hackers. THey split the bounty 50/50 bnecause the trust each other. He uses Amass -> httpx -
title `amass enum -passive -norecursive -noalts -d indeed.com | httpx -title
If he sees dashboard or grafana or things like that he goes and checks [them](https://youtu.be/1-
IB8TE0Hro?t=484 for a daboard.
Then he copies them and throws them in nulcei to check for any cves
After amass, you think you hve all the subdomains but you actualy don't until you hve portscanned.
THey arent running on port 80 or 443
Amass and one4all to subdomain enumeration manually then [sort unique to rengine]. On rengine he
runs portscanning. If his Portscaning / finds anything useful it uploads that info to his Discord Server.
He has his phone on him 24/7 and if he sees something like [port 22687]((https://youtu.be/1-
IB8TE0Hro?t=904), a CGI Panel, Grafana, or 'the Deep Console is up', he just throws that link to Nuclei
t THen he uses httpx with -title flag He uses Ports he scans 1-1000 on the fly then He uses Rengine for
cron jobs and all port scanning
His Nuclei Command to scan ports after porn scanning nuclei target
http://indeed.hire.emploetfindeed.com:2086 -t nuclei_templates/tehnologies  Another things he
does is Enumate ASN. Search Subdomains on Shodan by asn:16509 and then filter by http.title and
you will find DIretory Listings olike "Index of /"
nuclei -target http://indeedhire-employer.indeed.com:2086 -t nuclei-templates/technologies/
one file looks like this:
and his other file looks like this: aarp.indeed.com AS16589 AS16589 - AMAZON.COM, INC. US
54.202.0.0/15 about.indeed.com AS16589 AS16589 - AMAZON.COM, INC. US 54.202.0.0/15

Secret tip Facet Analysis in shodan - The Tops Ports are listed and it shows 5 of them, he clicks on
'more' and that opens up the Facet Analysis Check the top ports for example google what is port

5432. Postgres. his favorite shodan query
Someting aobut client ASNs i'm note xactly sure what he was getting at, check back ter.
This sums up the Shodan / Seccret tip portion, he finds the ASN, searchs it in Shodan, goes to facet
analysis, go to http.title and filter out the results. Another one he will do is redis.key when hes on the
shodan page of a redis server that is running, ports is another option he will filter by.
He get those ASN's from his portscanner (on rengine)
After running HTTPx,he runs ffuf on 302s, vhosts, 403 he will send it to ffuf. He uses six2dev's
Onelistforall, in particular OnelistforallSHort.txt. He also uses Github words wordlist He uses the
english WL with ffuf like so: `ffuf -c -u https://au.conv.indeed.com/FUZZ.html -w words_alpha.txt
His Puredns command puredns bruteforce /root/w/best-dns-wordlist.txt dell.com -r

His Mentor/Friend Sechunt3r shared a program with him and he found his first bug there which was a
file upload restriction bypass. He made a goal to submit 20 bug reports daily
He Doesn't use Checklists, he uses The Latest Writeups and says if you aren't checking (for what was
found in the writeup) you are missing out
He talks about how he is making 80k a month
He likes to figure out origin IP and getting access to Admin Panels. He got into 4 admin panels in one
