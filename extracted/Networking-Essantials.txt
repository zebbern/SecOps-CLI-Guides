Routing protocols 
Used to determine the path. Eg. RIP, IGRP, OSPF, etc. 
Routed protocols 
That carries the packets, e.g. IP, IPX, and AppleTalk. 
 
Routing protocols  
*   Interior Gateway Protocols- used to exchange information inside the same autonomous system.  
*   Exterior Gateway Protocols - to communicate between autonomous systems. Eg. BGP 
 
IGP   Distance vector  RIP, IGRP 
        
 Link State  OSPF, NLSP 
       
 Hybrid  IS-IS, EIGRP 
 
 

RIP   Routing information protocol 
IGRP   Interior Gateway Protocol (Cisco proprietary)

WAN TECHNOLOGIES 
 
Types of WAN connections 
1. 
Leased line connections 
2. 
Circuit switched connections 
3. 
Packet switched connections 
 
Leased-line connections 
 can be called a point-to-point ( dedicated connection ) 
 Provides a single, pre-established WAN communication path. 
 Synchronous 
 Speed T3 ( 45 Mbps ) 
 Synchronous communications involve digital signals that are transmitted with precise 
clocking 
 Very expensive. 
 
Circuit-switching 
 provides a dedicated physical circuit, which stays in place  between the sender and the 
receiver for the duration of the communication session. 
 Telephone company network uses the system to provide basic telephone services or ( ISDN 
– Integrated Services Digital Network ) 
 Basic telephone services are asynchronous serial communication. 
 
Packet-switching 
 Packet-switching method involves network devices sharing a single point-to-point link. 
 Point-to-point link is used to transport packets from source to destination over a 
telecommunication carrier network. 
 Statistically programmed switching devices provide physical connections 
 Packet headers are used to identify the destination 
 Less expensive 
 Synchronous serial lines 
 Speed 56 Kbps ( T3 ) 
 
Physical items needed for WAN link 
1. 
Customer Premises Equipment ( CPE ) 
2. 
A Demarcation ( DEMARC ) 
3. 
A Local loop ( last mile ) – copper wire 
4. 
a central office ( CO ) switch 
5.

Types of serial cable supported by CISCO devices 
Serial cables can support leased-lines and packet-switched connections. 
1. 
EIA / TIA – 232 
2. 
EIA / TIA – 449 
3. 
EIA / TIA – 530 
4. 
X.25 
5. 
V.35 
 
DTE – Data Terminal Equipment is your CPE. 
DCE – Data Communication Equipment – to convert the user data from DTE into a form that’s 
acceptable to the WAN service provider. 
The synchronous serial ports can be configured a either DTE or DCE, depending on the attached 
cable. 
EIA / TIA – 530 serial ports can be configured as DTE only. 
 
 External clocking from the channel service unit/ data service unit ( CSU/DSU ) or other 
DIC device is needed when the port is configured as DTE. 
 When traffic is crossing the WAN link, each WAN connection uses a protocol to 
encapsulate it. 
 WAN encapsulation protocols operate at layer 2 of the OSI model. 
 The choice of encapsulation protocol depends on the WAN technology and the 
communication equipment. 
 
WAN protocols 
1. 
HDLC –High-level Data Link Control 
2. 
PPP – Point-to-point protocol 
3. 
SLIP – Serial Line Interface protocol 
4. 
X.25 
5. 
Frame Relay 
6. 
ATM – Asynchronous Transfer Mode 
 
HDLC – frame format 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HDLC 
 The default encapsulation type on point-to-point ,dedicated link is HDLC. 
 It’s typically used for communication between two Cisco devices and is a bit-oriented 
synchronous protocol. 
 
SLIP 
 SLIP predates PPP. 
 It uses a variation of TCP/IP and is a standard protocol for point-to-point serial connections 
 
PPP 
 PPP provides router-to-router and host-to-network connections over synchronous and 
asynchronous circuits. 
 Can work with IP and IPX. 
 Security mechanisms such as PAP  ( Password Authentication Protocol) and CHAP ( 
Challenge Handshake Authentication protocol ) are built into PPP. 

Configuring PPP 
Router ( config ) # int s 0 
Router ( config-if ) # encapsulation PPP 
Router ( config-if ) # exit 
 
Configuration PPP authentication 
Step 1.  Setting username, password for remote router connecting to your router 
Router ( config )# hostname Router A  
Router A ( config )# username Router B password Cisco  
Router A ( config )#  # exit 
 
Step 2.  Configuring PAP or CHAP 
Router A ( config ) # int s 0 
Router A ( config-if ) # PPP authentication chap pap 
Router A ( config-if ) # exit 
 
Verifying PPP encapsulation 
Router A # show int s 0 
 
PAP contains four main components 
1. 
A physical layer International Standard for serial communication. i.e. EIA/TIA 232 C, 
V.24, V.35, and ISDN. 
2. 
A method for encapsulating datagram over serial links. i.e.  HDLC. 
3. 
A method of establishing, configuring, maintaining and terminating the point-to-point 
connection. LCP – Line Control Protocol 
4. 
NCP – Network Control Protocol – to allow communications of multiple network layer 
protocols. 
 
PPP Session Establishment

SWITCHING 
 
 Ethernet switches operate at layer 2 of the OSI model and function in a similar way 
to bridges. 
 Ethernet switches and bridge forward and filter traffic based on MAC address. 
 Switches and bridges identify host locations through a process known as Address 
learning. 
 Switches and bridges provide Loop avoidance function in a network. 
 When a switch is first initialized, it’s MAC data base is empty. So it forwards the 
received message to all its port. This is known as Flooding. 
 IEEE 802.1 Specifications defines a time limit of 300 seconds for MAC database 
entries to remain in the database. 
 When the frame reaches the switch, the destination MAC address is compared to 
the entries in the MAC database. The switch then transmits the frame only to the 
port which matches the MAC address. This is known as FRAME FILTERING. 
 Bridged and Switched networks are often designed with Redundant devices and 
links in order to prevent a single point of failure in a network. 
 Redundant systems can cause bridge loops . ie problems caused due to bridge loops. 
a. Broadcast storms 
b. Multiple frame copies 
c. Instability in the MAC database. 
 
 Some layer-3 protocols use Time to line ( TTL ) mechanism which eliminates 
looping packets. 
 TTL – Field in IP header to indicate how long a packet can travel before it is 
returned or discarded. 
 Layer-2 protocols like Ethernet are unable to prevent packets from endlessly 
looping. 
 To prevent broadcast storms, multiple frame copies and MAC database instability, a 
loop avoidance mechanism is used. i.e. SPANNING – TREE PROTOCOL ( STP ) 
 STP is a link – management protocol that allows redundant systems to exist in the 
network but prevents undesired bridge loops. 
 STP is a part of IEEE 802.LD standard , so it can function with complaint bridge 
and switches from other vendors. 
 STP works by forcing certain redundant data paths into a standby or blocked state. 
 When the topology of the network changes, STP reconfigures bridge ports to 
prevent the creation of new loops or loss of connectivity. 
 Each port on a bridge or switch is included in STP support. 
 All switches in a LAN participating in STP gather information on other switches in 
the network through an exchange of data messages. This is known as BRIDGE 
PROTOCOL DATA UNITS ( BPDU ) 
 

 
ROOT BRIDGE ELECTION 
 
Default priority of the bridges is 32,678 
Root bridge will be a bridge with less Bridge ID. If the  bridge ID is same for all the bridge, then 
the MAC address is considered. A bridge with less MAC address will be the rest bridge.

5. 
Less number of ports (max. 16) 
more number of ports (>100) 
6. 
Used to separate LAN traffic into segments  used to connect directly to end-users   
 
 
 
 
 
 
and other switches. 
7. 
Cannot offer dedicated bandwidth to each segment can offer dedicated  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bandwidth to end users. 
 
Two ways of transmitting frame through a switch 
1. Store- and – Forward  
a. Forwarding does not take place until the entire frame has been received by switch. 
b. Switch reads the destination and source address and performs CRC to ensure the 
frame is not damaged. 
c. If damaged, the frame is discarded. 
d. Latency time is high since it has to check the frame and also varies with regard to 
size of the frame. 
Latency time is the delay between receiving a frame and forwarding 
 
2. Cut-through  
a. Forwards the frame just by seeing the destination address only. 
b. Latency time is constant and less. 
 
VLAN 
 
1. Static - Administrator creates VLAN. 
2. Dynamic – uses VMP3 (VLAN management policy server) to create VLANs. 
 
Creating VLANs 
1900 (config) # vlan 2 name sales 
 
 
 # Vlan 3 name mark 
 
 
 # Exit 
 # Show vlan 
 
Assigning switch ports 
1900 ( config ) # int e 0/2 
 
 
 # vlan-membership static 2 
 
 
 # int e 0/3 
 
 
 # vlan-membership static 3 
 
Configuring trunk port 
1900 ( config ) # int f 0/2l 
 
 
# trunk on 
 
 1900 switch only runs on DISK (Dynamic ISC) encapsulation. 

VTP – VLAN Trunk Protocol 
1. 
Messaging protocol that is used to distribute VLAN Configuration information. 
2. 
Supports mixed-media backbones. 
3. 
Takes control of addition, detection, and name changes on the network. 
 
A VTP management domain can be either one switch or multiple interconnected switching sharing 
the same VTP server. 
VLANs are not propagated over the network until 2 VTP domain name is specified or discovered. 
 
VTP operates in three modes. 
1. Server ( default ) 
2. Client 
3. Transparent 
 
Server mode 
 A switch acting at this mode can create, delete and modify VLAN’s for the entire 
VTP domain. 
 Advertise its VLAN configuration 
 Synchronize its VLAN configuration with information received from other devices 
in the domain. 
 Forward VTP advertisements received from other switches in the domain. 
 It saves VLAN configuration into NVRAM and recreates VLAN whenever the 
switch is booting. 
 
Client mode 
 create VTP advertisements 
 synchronize its VLAN configuration 
 forward VTP messages. 
 VTP transparent switch can create and modify VLANs. But it is confined to the 
local switch only. It is not transmitted to other switches in the domain. 
 Does not participate in domain. 
 
** VTP advertisements are automatically sent every five minutes or whenever a change 
occurs in a VLAN configuration.  Advertisement includes  1.  configuration-revision 
number. 
 
*** VTP PRUNING- technique that uses VLAN advertisements to determine when a 
trunk connection is flooding messages unnecessarily. 
 
Configuring VTP 
1900 ( config ) # vtp server 
 
 
      # vtp domain iiht 
 
 
      # vtp password cisco 
 
 
 
 
To see domain status, use    
 
 
     # show vtp ( statistics )

Switch ( config-if ) # switch port mode access 
Switch ( config-if ) # switch port access vlan 3 
…………….. 
………………… 
 
 
       # Exit 
 

Step 5.  Configuring router for Inter-VLAN 
 
Router > enable 
Router # config t 
Router ( config ) # int fa 0/0 
Router ( config-if ) # no ip address 
Router ( config-if ) # no shutdown 
Router ( config-if ) # int fa 0/0.1

To configure cdp timer and hold time 
Router ( config) # cdp timer 90 
Router ( config ) # cdp hold time 24 
Router ( config ) exit 
 
 
To turn off cdp completely 
Router ( config ) # no cdp run 
 
To turn off cdp for an interface 
 
# no cdp enable 
 
To turn on cdp for an interface 
 
 
 
 
# cdp enable 
 
 
Gathering cdp information 
1. # sh cdp neighbour 
2. # sh cdp neighbor detail 
3. # sh cdp traffic 
 
 
 
 

STP 
 Definition – allows link redundancy and prevents layer two loops 
 Port states 
 BPDO 
 Root election 
 Root path cost 
 Root and designated ports 
 Convergence 
  
Port States 
Turn on the switch  Blocking  Enabled 
 
 
 
 
    STP Disabled 
1. Listening – the port listens for any message regarding the blocking state. This listening 
time is known as Forward Delay Timer ( default is 15 sec) 
2. Learning ( default 15 sec ) – if no message is received regarding the blocking state till 15 
secs the ports moves to the learning state. In learning state, the switch identifies where it is 
located in the topology and maintains a  database for forwarding. ie. Is known as 
Forwarding database 
3. Forwarding state – forwards the data 
 
NAT – Network Address Translation 
 allows a host that does not have a valid registered IP address communicate with other hosts 
through the internet 
 NAT used a valid registered IP address to represent the non-registered IP address. 
 
Private Address 
 non-registered IP address used inside a network 
 
Range 
Class C – 10.X.X.X   ( 10.0.0.0  to 10.255.255.255 ) 
Class B -  172.16.X.X  ( 172.16.0.0   to  172.31.255.255 ) 
Class C -  192.168.X.X ( 192.168.0.0  to 192.168.255.255 ) 
 
NAT 
 Static  
 Dynamic  
 Overloading 
 
Static NAT 
1 private address: 1 public address 
 
E.g.  Private   
 
public 
10.1.1.1 
200.1.1.1 
10.1.1.2 
200.1.1.2 
 
 
 
 
 

Static NAT 
 
Router ( config) # ip nat inside source static 192.168.10.1    200.1.1.1 
Router ( config ) # int e 0 
Router ( config )   # ip nat inside  
Router ( config ) # int s 0 
 
     
Router ( config ) # ip nat outside 
Router # show ip nat translation 
 
Overloading NAT with PAT 
PAT – Port Address Translation 
 to support lots of inside local IP addresses with only a few inside global, publically 
registered IP address. NAT overload uses PAT. Instead of just translating the IP address, it 
also translates the port number. 
 
PAT 
Router ( config )  # ip nat inside source list 1 pool hcl overload 
 
 
           # ip nat pool hcl 200.0.0.1  200.0.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0 
 
 
 
# int e 0 
 
 
 
# ip nat inside 
 
 
 
# int s 0 
 
 
 
# ip nat outside  
 
 
 
# debug ip nat ( * telnet from source ) 
 
 
 
 
# show ip nat translations 
 
Dynamic NAT 
 Sets up a pool of possible inside global address and defines criteria for the set of inside 
local IP addresses whose traffic should be translated with NAT. 
 Address is dynamically assigned. 
 
Router ( config ) # access-list 1 permit192.168.10.0   0.0.0.255 
Router ( config ) # ip nat inside source list 1 pool hcl 
Router ( config ) # ip nat pool hcl 200.0.0.1   200.0.0.5 netmask 255.255.255.0 
Router ( config ) # int e 0 
Router ( config ) # ip nat inside 
Router ( config ) # int s 0 
Router ( config ) # ip nat outside 
 
 
  # debug ip nat ( * ping from source ) 
Password recovery 
 
Enable - go to privilege mode 
Router # copy startup-config running –config 
Router # config t 
Router ( config ) # enable secret  
< pw >  change pw 
Router ( config ) # exit 
Router ( config ) # config-register 0*2102   to reset original configuration 
Router # copy running-config startup-config
