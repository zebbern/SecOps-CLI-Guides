Pentest Best Practices 
Checklist

INTRODUCTION 
Damn, but security is hard. 
It’s not always obvious what needs doing, and the payoffs of good security are at best 
obscure. Who is surprised when it falls off our priority lists? 
Running a ﬁrst (or even your 100th) Pentest can be a daunting experience, but it 
shouldn’t feel like a chore. We’d like to offer a little help if you don’t mind. And by « help » 
we don’t mean « pitch you our product »—we genuinely mean it. 
Sqreen’s mission is to empower engineers to build secure web applications. We’ve put our 
security knowledge to work in compiling an actionable list of best practices to help you 
get a grip on your penetration tests. It’s all on the following pages. 
We hope your ﬁnd if useful. If you do, share it with your network. And if you don’t, please 
take to Twitter to complain loudly—it’s the best way to get our attention.

SCOPE 
✔  Why are you even doing a pentest? 
The ﬁrst question that one needs to answer is about the goals of the penetration test. 
Penetration tests can take several forms and can solve a lot of different problems 
(improving security, ensuring compliance, making some customers happy etc.). Make 
sure you are clear on the objectives. A pentest might not even be the right solution to 
your problem. Outcomes alignment with objectives is key to having a successful pentest.

✔  Know your pentests 
Internal pentest vs. External pentest. Security audit vs. vulnerability assessment vs. 
penetration test vs. private bug bounty etc. The wordings can quickly become very 
confusing. Make sure you are aware of the different terminologies and use them properly 
to make sure you get what you want.

✔  Enumerate likely threats  
If your pentest goal is about uncovering vulnerabilities then you need to perform a risk 
assessment of your business. You don’t need to be a security expert to reﬂect on this. Just 
think about the places that can hurt you the most. Are you collecting sensitive data? Are 
you running legacy applications? etc.

✔  Define the pentesting scope  
As your resources are most probably limited, whether it is time, budget or expertise, 
deﬁne the scope of the pentests you would like to perform. Based on the previously 
threats list or risks map, determine in which areas vulnerabilities if exploited will most 
likely hit your business directly or indirectly (e.g:  loss of revenue if web application is 
down, damage to your reputation following user data theft…) 
✔  Determine a budget 
There’s the $50 “script-kiddie” on Fiverr and there’s the hundred thousand dollars 
pentest. Your budget is an important discriminating factor and it has to be aligned with 
your objectives and the value of your assets. Eventually, you end up getting what you paid 
for (in most cases…). If you are looking to ﬁnd critical vulnerabilities in a very complex 
architecture or if you are interested in reassuring your customers with a big brand by 
putting a seal of approval on your security practices; you will need to pay the price. 
✔  Prepare the pentest environment 
Pentests can and should be conducted on production environment, however certain limits 
should be set for the testing team. The most obvious one being never to run DoS attacks 
or fuzzing on production. If testing cannot be performed on the production environment, 
set up an environment that is absolutely identical to production and create user accounts 
for the pentesters, depending on the decided testing style. If the tests need to be done on 
production directly, schedule them in such a way as to avoid slowing the network 
response time for the company and your customers.

✔  Launch scanners before  
Pentests will reveal the ugly truth about your systems or your applications. However, if 
you already know some of your vulnerabilities and basic issues, take the time to run 
scanners and ﬁx the issues instead of wasting valuable pentesting time and energy 
uncovering what you already know or could know with other automated tools. 
✔  Review the organization’s security policy   
As regulations are more and more stringent, make sure to be compliant with the security 
policies and regulations especially when it comes to sensitive data handling. 
Rules of engagement - http://bit.ly/2PxyIUa 
✔  Notify your hosting provider   
Inform yourself about which tests are allowed by your hosting or cloud provider, and 
request the appropriate authorizations before the tests.

✔  Freeze developments in the pentest environment    
The value of pentests is to test the system as a whole and not individual bricks of it. 
Pentests will uncover vulnerabilities within a context. If you change that context by 
deploying patches or new packages or changing hardware components, the results of the 
pentests could not be valid anymore. Unless you need to ﬁx a critical customer bug, 
refrain from any release during the pentest duration. The security auditors are working 
with time limits, as opposed to most attackers, and are cutting corners to get their results. 
If you ﬁx the issues they are exploiting, you make them waste their time, and thus your 
money.

EXPERTISE 
✔  Find the right pentesters for the job 
Finding good pentesters should be done via recommendation. Ask your friends, 
colleagues, investors, or even Hacker for recommendations. Make sure the suggestions ﬁt 
with your objectives. Hiring pentesters without a strong recommendation and reputation 
is probably a no-go. Also, make sure that you have the right experts for your target 
domains: if you are looking to pentest your network you need a pentester that specializes 
in this ﬁeld. An expert will know how the systems are built and their common weaknesses.

✔  The more trustworthy the company, the more trustful your clients 
are gonna be  
Pentests are tools to uncover vulnerabilities but they are also reassuring your clients. So if 
you are going the extra length as to hire a pentester, you might as well get a good one. 
Remember that you will mostly get what you paid for. If you hire cheap, you will most 
probably get sloppy work. Check the pentesters credentials and talk to previous clients if 
possible.

✔  Define pentest methodology 
Based on your target environment and objectives, deﬁne the testing style and the access 
that will be provided to the testers: no access to simulate external attacks or full access to 
simulate insider job. If you are relying on external testers, ask them what their 
methodology is and ensure your objectives are met. If you are doing the pentesting 
internally, make sure it is aligned with security frameworks and consists mainly of manual 
advanced testing and not only automated.

✔  Define pentest report format  
Get a sample report to familiarize yourself with its content and ensure the metrics and 
content covers your objectives and areas of interest. If you have a risk management 
system and you want to integrate the ﬁndings in it, you might also want to ask the 
pentesting company for a CSV or XML format in addition to the PDF report they will 
deliver.

✔  Do not forget to cleanup the pentesting environment  
The auditors should clean up the tested environment. This typically includes removing 
rootkits, backdoors, executables and scripts as well as any temporary ﬁles created. The 
user accounts created for the pentesters should be removed as well. If data were modiﬁed 
or deleted or if settings were changed, everything should be reconﬁgured back to its 
original state. 
✔  Schedule for a next pentest  
As your systems evolve quickly, the penetration test ﬁndings will soon be outdated and 
other vulnerabilities created. Some companies schedule to perform penetration tests 
regularly, such as once a year. You will need to ﬁgure out if pentests are the right tools for 
your needs and how often will you need to run them (depending on your applications 
release frequency, hardware and network upgrades, etc.)

MONITORING 
✔  Implement a security monitoring solution  
Security monitoring solutions are part of your security arsenal, you should implement 
them before embarking on the pentests. The pentesters will, by the way, be interested in 
knowing how far they could go until being detected by the Intrusion Detection Service 
(IDS) for example. You can use tools like Sqreen to prevent data breaches, protect your 
customers, stop business logic attacks and get full visibility on your security..

Intrusion detection critical but not as a standalone solution - http://bit.ly/2FpEl2l 
✔  Implement a logging solution 
Logs are the most precious assets to monitor the environment and to investigate a 
suspicious activity or a security breach. If you don’t already have a logging solution set up, 
a centralised log platform enables to make the most out of the analytics capabilities and 
provides a view across all themes (applications, network, users, etc.). It will be useful in 
registering pentests activities and impacts on your systems and applications.

✔  Closely monitor your exception tools 
Ask your team to pay extra attention to exception management and error handling 
systems as they will provide valuable information on the pentest impacts. Your team 
should be kept up to date on the current pentests to be able to discern if the errors come 
from usual user activity or as a result of the pentest. 
 7

✔  Monitor your security monitoring tool 
Your security monitoring tools should pick up the activity from the pentests. However, 
you might have real attacks occurring at the same time. Make sure your team is up to 
date on the performed pentests to be able to distinguish the attacks.

REMEDIATION 
✔  Ensure you have an uncorrupted backup of your data and system 
configurations 
There is a risk that the pentest knocks down your systems, and deletes or modiﬁes your 
data as any real attack would, so you should make sure that you have backups ready 
should this happen. No professional pentester can guarantee that there will be zero risk of 
system failure or data deletion and modiﬁcation, especially if the testing takes place in 
production environment. 
✔  Start reserving time for after the pentest  
Make sure you and key people from your team will be available after the pentests to study 
the report and ﬁx the vulnerabilities uncovered by the pentests. 
 ✔  Do not patch vulnerabilities during the tests 
Ask the pentesters to inform you on the most critical vulnerabilities during the test, but 
don’t patch them right away as you would be modifying the pentest environment, rather 
use the time to deﬁne a ﬁx and schedule it to be rolled out as soon as the pentests are 
done and the results are understood. 
✔  Make sense of the pentest report  
Once you receive the pentest report, share the technical version promptly with your 
team. If you have trouble understanding it, call the security auditors and do not hesitate 
to request a clariﬁcation meeting should you still have trouble (that’s OK, these guys are 
security auditors, not professional writers!). 
Ensure the report is understood by your team. If it isn’t by everyone, organize a test 
session to reproduce the issue with the team (at Sqreen, we call it hack nights and it 
comes with beers & pizzas). 
 9

✔  Prioritize the report findings  
The auditors will sort the vulnerabilities given their technical criticity. Review this 
prioritization to ensure it is also compatible with the business direct or indirect impacts. 
You can use Sqreen to easily differentiate between real vulnerabilities and false positives. 
✔  Make sure you got alerted about the critical attacks during the 
pentest. 
Scan the report to make sure you were informed about all the critical attacks performed 
during the tests and what their impacts were. These attacks might have uncovered critical 
vulnerabilities, but could also have impacted your system and modiﬁed or deleted your 
data. 
✔  Allocate resources to fix vulnerabilities 
You probably would like to assign a dedicated taskforce to tackle the vulnerabilities 
uncovered. Make sure to allocate sufficient time and appropriate expertise for this task. 
Use Sqreen to get a Stacktrace on the identiﬁed vulnerabilities and fasten the 
remediation cycle. 
✔  Re-Test after the fix  
Some pentesting contracts can offer a re-testing phase at no additional cost after the 
vulnerabilities have been ﬁxed to validate that the remediation effort has been successful. 
It is useful to re-test in order to close the ﬁndings and ensure the remediation actions did 
not open other vulnerabilities. 
 10

COMMUNICATION 
✔  Communicate with your team 
Tell your team a security test is going to be performed. You may gasify this and play to see 
how long they take to ﬁnd out the pentest has started. You should also communicate the 
test ending date. Also, set up a communication channel between the pentesters and your 
team (yourself included) to ensure communication during the pentests goes smoothly 
and information do not get lost in translation. 
✔  Make sure you are available 
Pentesters will have questions during the tests, and will need to discuss with you the leads 
they are pursuing. Appoint a single point of contact within your team and make yourself 
available for the critical questions. You should schedule regular quick meetings to 
understand their progress (if they are lost or steadily advancing). They have limited time 
and to make the most out of this pentest, you should help them. 
 ✔  Check your team members’ attitude 
Pentests are not light exercises, they should be taken seriously, make sure your team is 
aware of their importance. However, make also sure that your team is not unnecessarily 
stressed out by them or taking the tests as a bad reﬂection on their job, but is rather open 
to improvement recommendations. 
 ✔  Communicate with your manager  
Cybersecurity is increasingly taking center stage within the companies, since they 
became aware of the serious impacts on the business. Consequently, security tests are 
often a big deal all the way up to the CEO and the board who are attentive to the 
projects and waiting for the results. Without being technical, be transparent and report 
regularly on the progress so that they are not surprised by the ﬁnal report. Identify 
beforehand some key indicators you could consistently report on so that the board 
members can follow the trends between the presentations.

 LESSONS LEARNED 
✔  Review the vulnerabilities with the team 
Some vulnerabilities uncovered by the pentesters within the scope of the pentest could 
exist in your other systems. Reﬂect with your team to ﬁnd out if similar vulnerabilities can 
exist elsewhere and if you could ﬁx them simultaneously. 
✔  Review the vulnerabilities to ensure they have not been exploited 
Use the logs to investigate if the uncovered vulnerabilities have been exploited. If that is 
the case, you should ﬁnd out the extent of the damage done, report on it to your 
manager and take appropriate remediation actions. 
✔  Adapt your processes to make sure vulnerabilities do not occur 
again 
The pentests should have long-lasting effects in your company. They uncover 
vulnerabilities in the systems but they should make you question why those vulnerabilities 
occurred, since they are only symptoms and not root causes. Take the time to reﬂect on 
how you could improve your processes to avoid similar vulnerabilities in the future.  
✔  Create training and update onboarding and offboarding 
Take the time to understand the lessons learned from the pentests, and include them in 
the employees training curriculum, whether they are technical or non-technical 
employees. Make sure to update employees onboarding and offboarding packages and 
processes as well.

✔  Evaluate penetration testing effectiveness  
Have the pentests achieved the goals you set? What could have been done differently/
better? The frustrating part about penetration tests is that when they ﬁnd vulnerabilities, 
it is bad news, but the absence of discoveries does not mean absence of vulnerability. Do 
not judge the pentest by how little or how many vulnerabilities were uncovered.

✔  Make sure your Incident Response Plan covers the uncovered 
vulnerabilities 
Review your Incident Response Plan in light of the ﬁndings to ensure it is well prepared 
for the vulnerabilities. Update the plan if needed, with detailed procedures and roles and 
responsibilities. Make sure to communicate it to your team and other stakeholders within 
the organization and schedule simulations training.
