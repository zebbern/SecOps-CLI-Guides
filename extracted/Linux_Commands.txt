Mounting with systemd 
• 
Create a file in /etc/system/system: 
The file name should match the path of the mount point. For example, 
if the mount point is /mnt/storage, the file should be named mnt-
storage.mount 
• 
File structure: 
The following should be added to the file:  
 
#general information about the unit 
[Unit]  
Description=Backup mount point  
 
#information used mounting 

[Mount]  
What=/dev/sda3 #its better to use the UUID (/dev/disk/by-uuid/<UUID>) 
Where=/mnt/Storage1 
Type=ext4 
Options=defaults  
 
[Install] 
WantedBy=multi-user.target #when it should be mounted.   
• 
 Tell system to reread unit files: 
Systemctl daemon-reload 
• 
Start and check the status of the mount: 
Systemctl start mnt-storage.mount 
 
Systemctl status mnt-storage.mount 
• 
Automatic mount at boot time:

• 
Check the status of firewalld: 
firewall-cmd --state 
• 
List available zones: 
firewall-cmd --get-zones 
• 
To see what the default zone is: 
firewall-cmd –-get-default-zones 
• 
List active zones with interfaces attached to them: 
firewall-cmd –-get-active-zones 
• 
List available zones: 
firewall-cmd --get-zones 
• 
To create a new zone: 
firewall-cmd --permanent --new-zone=testZone  
#Note: use -–permanent to write the configuration to disk 
• 
To reload the firewall: 
firewall-cmd --reload 
• 
To change the zone of an interface: 
firewall-cmd –-zone=<new zone> --change-interface=<interface 
name> --permanent 
#Note: Normally, when using –-permanent you need to reload 
firewalld to apply the config to runtime, but in the case of 
changing the zone firewalld updates both permanent config and 
runtime.  
• 
List all supported services: 
firewall-cmd -–get-services 
• 
To allow a service in a specific zone: 

firewall-cmd –-permanent –-zone=<zone name> –-add-
service=<service zone> 
 
#Note: if you are modifying the default zone, then you don’t have 
to specify the zone. 
#Note: This is being written to disk, so you will have to reload 
the firewall and that will interrupt the network traffic. To 
avoid that run the command again without –-permanent to  modify 
what the config running in the ram

Security  
encrypting disks with luks 
It is a good idea to use shred to make sure that the previous data is not recoverable and securely 
wiped. 
sudo shred -v -–iterations=3 /dev/sdX 
 
encryption using luks 
1. sudo cryptsetup luksFormat <device> 
this will format the disk as an encrypted disk, so make sure you back up your data and it is 
always a good idea to unmount the drive. 
2. sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda <assign a name to it> 
this will create a mapper entry for the encrypted disk using the name you assign: 
/dev/mapper/my_encrypted_vol. you will also use it to open the volume once you encrypted 
3. sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/my_encrypted_vol 
 
4. sudo mount /dev/mapper/my_encrypted_volume /mnt/my_mount_point 
format the encrypted disk with a file system of your choice and mount it.  
5. sudo umount /mnt/my_mount_point  
6. sudo cryptsetup luksClose my_encrypted_volume 
after you are done first unmount it and then close it using the above command, or if you 
shutdown the system it will automatically unmount it and closed it  
audit tool 
a tool for monitoring and tracking system events for security and compliance purposes. It allows 
administrators to track access to files, monitor system calls, and detect suspicious behavior in the 
system. 
Key Components of audit 
• 
auditd: The main audit daemon is responsible for writing audit events to the log. 
• 
Audit rules: These are the rules that define which events are captured (e.g., system calls, 
file access, etc.). . Note: usually stored in /etc/audit/audit.rules 
• 
Audit logs: The logs generated by auditd are typically found in /var/log/audit/audit.log. 

 
sudo auditctl -w /etc/passwd -p wa -k passwd_changes 
•  -w : Watch the file /etc/passwd. 
•  -p : Monitor write and attribute changes. 
•  -k : Add a key to identify the audit rule. 
 
auditctl -l : list audit rules 
ausearch -k : view the logs of a specific file 
changing ssh keys 
it’s recommended to regenerate the ssh keys after the first boot, because during the first boot of a 
system it might not have enough entropy(randomness) to generate a strong key so the key will be 
less secure and predictable. It is the default for RedHat-based distros 
1. Navigate to /etc/ssh and delete the ssh keys  
2. Regenerate the keys using ssh-keygen. Make sure you create all of them and use the same 
file names as the previous keys 
sudo ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key 
3. When you are finished generating the keys, restart the ssh daemon (sshd) 
SELinux 
Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a security architecture for Linux systems that enforces access 
control policies to govern how processes and users can interact with files, devices, and other 
processes, so it adds an additional layer of security 
 
Enforcing Mode: SELinux policy is enforced, and violations are blocked and logged. 
Permissive Mode: SELinux policy is not enforced, but violations are logged. This mode is often 
used for troubleshooting. 
Disabled: SELinux is turned off entirely. 
 
sestatus 
getenforce  
This command will give you information about SELinux, getenforce will give you only the 
current mode, while sestatus will give you more information such current mode and mode 
configured in config file......... Note: to see the log files generated by SELinux, you can navigate to /var/log/audit/audit.log 

sudo setenforce permissive/enforcing 
Temporarily change SELinux, you can use the number instead of the words. Permissive is 0 
and enforcing is 1 
 
ls -Z /var/www/html 
to see the SELinux context of the files in this directory  
 
ps auxZ 
display process with their SELinux context 
 
sudo chcon -t httpd_sys_content_t /var/www/html/index.html 
Used to temporarily change the context of a file 
 
sudo restorecon /var/www/html/index.html 
this will revert a file to its default context, so any changes made by chcon will go  
 
sudo semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t '/mydata(/.*)?' 
 
To change a context and make it persistence use the above command. This will change the 
default context, so after running this command, run restorecon on the same file to change it 
to the new context. 
 
sudo semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 8080  
to add a port to the allowed ports for httpd  
 
AppArmor 
Similar to SELinux, AppArmour Provides mandatory access control. Unlike SELinux which uses 
subjects (e.g. processes) and Objects (e.g. file, port, dir), AppArmour implements a profile-based 
approach (more user-friendly)  where every application protected by AppArmour has a profile, 
which is a file 

Enforcing Mode: In this mode, AppArmor enforces the rules defined in the profile. Any action that 
violates the policy will be blocked and logged. 
Complain (Permissive) Mode: In this mode, violations are logged but not blocked. This is useful for 
debugging and developing new profiles. 
 
sudo aa-status 
display the current status, loaded profiles, and what mode they are put in.  
 
sudo aa-unconfined 
list process running without AppArmor profile  
 
sudo aa-genprof /usr/bin/apache2 
To generate a new profile for an application, once you run the command it start monitoring 
the application activity to generate the profile.  
 
sudo aa-logprof  
used to update existing profiles. Once you run the command it will analzye the logs 
generated while the profile was in complain mode and helps you by suggesting changes to 
the corresponding profiles 
 
sudo aa-autodep  
a quick, initial and basic profile generated by anlayzing the application, and it will include 
the permission for necessary dependencies. A good starting point, if don’t want to go 
through the process of aa-genprof immediately.  
 
sudo aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.apache2 
put a profile into enforcing mode 
 
sudo aa-complain /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.apache2 
put a profile into complain mode 
 
sudo aa-disable /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.apache2 

disable a profile. 
 
sudo aa-remove-unknown  
removes unknown/unused AppArmor profiles. 
 
  
 
 
Installing and Managing Software 
apt : used to manage packages on Debian-based distros. Note: it combines the functionality of apt-get and apt-
cache 
yum/dnf : the package manager for redhat-based distros. Note: yum is being gradually replaced by dnf, so dnf is 
the future 
rpm : redhat package manager, this is the old package manager that redhat-based ditsro used to 
use. Note: you shouldn’t use it as it has been replaced by yum/dnf, however it is still used to import GPG key  
 
apt options 
apt list : used to list packages. Note: used if you know what you are looking for  
apt search : used to search for packages by keywords. Note: used if you don’t know what you are looking 
for, so you can provide a keyword, and it will search in the packages and their description for a match 
apt install : used to install packages. 
apt-key add : to add a key or a hash, so it can be used to verify packages. 
apt update : to update the apt cache.  
apt upgrade : to upgrade the software packages installed. 
apt full-upgrade :upgrade packages and install new packages or remove existing ones as 
needed. 
apt remove : to remove/uninstall a software. 
apt autoremove : Removes dependency libraries and packages that are no longer required. 
apt clean : Clears the APT cache. 
apt autoclean : Cleans up partially downloaded packages. 

 
yum/dnf options  
yum list: to list available packages with a specific word. 
yum search : to search in repos for a package by a keyword. 
yum info: to see information about a package . 
yum install : to install packages. 
yum remove : to remove/uninstall a software. 
dnf autoremove : look for any unused dependencies and remove them. 
yum update :  to update the cache, install the updates, and upgrade the OS. Note: unlike apt 
where you have three different commands; one for updating the cache, one for installing the updates, and one for upgrading 
the distro, yum update combines the three in one command 
yum provides */xeyes : to find the package name fo xeyes  
rpm --import : to add a key or a hash, so it can be used to verify packages. 
 
 
Git 
• 
Install git:  
sudo apt install git  
sudo dnf/yum install git 
• 
save git configuration on the system level: 
git config --system 
• 
save git configuration for a user: 
git config –-global  
#Note: you need to be logged in as that user 
• 
save git configuration just for the project: 
git config –-local  
#Note: you can remove –-local as it’s the default  
• 
basic configuration (name, email, the text editor you want to use and turn on 
colors): 
git config –-global user.name “Hussain Ahmed” 

git config –-global user.email “husmohdali@gmail.com” 
git config –-global core.editor “vim” 
git config –-global color.ui true 
 
#Note: this is a user-level config, so you need --global  
• 
list configuration:  
 
git config –-list  
• 
initialize a directory to be tracked by git: 
git init  
#Note: you need to be inside the directory where you want to 
initialize the repository. Also, you can do ls -al to double check 
that the .git dir has been created 
• 
check git status (which files aren’t being tracked, any changes have been 
made): 
git status  
• 
start tracking a file (push to staging area): 
git add test1.txt 
#Note: it’s like you telling git to pay attention to this file, but it 
doesn't know if changes have been made. 
 
#Note: you can use . to specifiy everything in the current directory. 
 
To execlude certain files from being tracked 
1. Create a .gitignore 
2. name the files inside the .gitignore  
 
 
 
 
• 
Commit changes (push to repository): 

#Note: it is like telling git that I made changes to the file keep 
track of them 
 
git commit -m “initial commit”  
 
#Note: -m to add a short description fo the changes. You can use -M 
and it will open the editor so you can add a detailed description. 
 
git commit -a  
 
#Note: commits all changes and open the editor to write a description 
 
• 
See your commits: 
git log 
• 
Check what chages have been made: 
git diff test.txt 
 
#Note: this will allow you to see the differences between the current 
version of the file and the last save point or the last vesion you 
committed 
• 
Roll back to the last save point: 
git checkout test.txt 
• 
Push a local repository to a remote repository : 
#Specify the remote repository 
git remote add <name> <url>  
#Note: in the name you can add anything, but it is a conventional rule 
to use origin as the name. 
 
#upload/push the local repository. Syntax: git push -u <name> <branch 
name> 
 
git push -u origin main 

 
• 
Download/clone a remote repository  : 
 git clone <url of remote repository> 
 
• 
Create a branch: 
 git branch <name of new branch> 
• 
List created branches: 
 git branch 
 
• 
Switch to another branch: 
 git checkout <branch name> 
• 
merge branches: 
 git merge <brach name>  
Capacity Planning  
iotop : to see disk I/O  
Sar 
SAR or System Activity Reporter is a service that runs in the background and collects performance 
data and logs it, so then you can go and read it later. It tracks CPU, memory, disk I/O and network 
I/O 
• 
install SAR: 
sudo apt install sysstat 
• 
 enable SAR: 
edit /etc/default/sysstat and make sure its enabled 
Ex:- 
ENABLED=”true”  
• 
Change how often SAR run: 
When you installed SAR, it created a cron job in /etc/cron.d, so 
navigate to this dir and edit the cron job inside sysstat file 
• 
Display collected performance data : 

sar [urbn] 
-u: CPU 
-r: RAM 
-b: disk I/O 
-n: network I/O
