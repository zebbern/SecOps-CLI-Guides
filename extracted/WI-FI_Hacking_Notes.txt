WI-FI Hacking Notes 
 
Wireless Adapter Connection to Kali Linux 
When performing Wi-Fi penetration testing with Kali Linux, it’s essential to use a wireless 
adapter that supports monitor mode and packet injection. Below is a guide on connecting a 
wireless adapter to Kali and ensuring it’s ready for penetration testing. 
1. Connecting the Wireless Adapter to Kali Linux 
Steps: 
1. Plug in the Wireless Adapter: Insert the wireless adapter into a USB port on your 
computer or laptop running Kali Linux. 
2. Check if Kali Recognizes the Adapter: 
• 
Open a terminal and type the command: 
• 
lsusb 
• 
This command lists all USB devices connected to your system. Look for an entry 
related to your wireless adapter (e.g., “Realtek Semiconductor Corp.” or “Atheros 
Communications, Inc.”). 
1. Ensure the Adapter is Enabled: 
• 
To check if your wireless adapter is recognized and enabled, use: 
• 
ifconfig 
• 
Look for an interface named something like wlan0, wlan1, etc. This represents your 
wireless interface. 
1. Installing Drivers (If Needed): 
• 
Most wireless adapters work out-of-the-box with Kali Linux, but in some cases, you 
might need to install drivers. If your adapter is not recognized, you may need to install 
the appropriate drivers for your wireless chipset. 
• 
For example, for Realtek chipsets: 
• 
sudo apt-get update 
• 
sudo apt-get install realtek-rtl88xxau-dkms 
2. Testing Monitor Mode Capabilities 
Monitor mode allows your wireless adapter to capture all packets on a network, even those 
not addressed to your device. Here’s how to enable and test it: 

 
 
 
2 
1. Enable Monitor Mode: 
• 
Use airmon-ng to enable monitor mode on your wireless adapter. 
• 
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0 
• 
This command will change the mode of the interface from wlan0 to something like 
wlan0mon (monitor mode). 
1. Check Monitor Mode: 
• 
To verify that your adapter is in monitor mode, use: 
• 
iwconfig 
• 
Look for your interface (wlan0mon). It should now be listed with Mode: Monitor. 
1. Start Capturing Packets: 
• 
Test the monitor mode by capturing packets with airodump-ng. 
• 
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon 
• 
This command should start showing you all the wireless networks in the vicinity. 
Understanding MAC Address 
1. What is a MAC Address? 
• 
MAC (Media Access Control) Address: A unique identifier assigned to network 
interfaces for communications at the data link layer of a network segment. 
• 
Format: Typically displayed as six groups of two hexadecimal digits, separated by 
colons (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E). 
Key Points: 
• 
Permanence: MAC addresses are usually hardcoded into a device’s network interface 
card (NIC) by the manufacturer. 
• 
Uniqueness: Each device’s MAC address should be unique, though some devices 
allow MAC address spoofing. 
2. Finding Your MAC Address 
Commands: 
• 
To find the MAC address of your wireless adapter: 
• 
ifconfig wlan0 | grep ether 
• 
This command will output something like: 
• 
mathematical 
• 
ether 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E txqueuelen 1000 (Ethernet) 
3. MAC Address Spoofing 

 
 
 
3 
• 
Spoofing: Changing the MAC address of your network interface to disguise your 
device or bypass certain network filters. 
• 
Command: 
• 
sudo ifconfig wlan0 down 
• 
sudo ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55 
• 
sudo ifconfig wlan0 up 
• 
The above commands temporarily change your MAC address. Replace wlan0 with 
your interface name and 00:11:22:33:44:55 with the desired MAC address. 
Wireless Modes: Managed & Monitor 
1. Managed Mode 
• 
Definition: The default mode for most wireless adapters, where the adapter connects 
to an access point (AP) and communicates with the network like a typical client. 
• 
Use Case: Used for everyday Wi-Fi activities such as browsing the internet, 
downloading files, or streaming. 
Commands: 
• 
Checking Mode: 
• 
iwconfig wlan0 
• 
The output should show Mode: Managed if in managed mode. 
• 
Switching to Managed Mode: 
• 
sudo ifconfig wlan0 down 
• 
sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode managed 
• 
sudo ifconfig wlan0 up 
2. Monitor Mode 
• 
Definition: A mode where the wireless adapter captures all wireless traffic in the 
vicinity, regardless of the destination. 
Use Case: Essential for tasks such as packet sniffing, network analysis, and penetration 
testing. 
Commands: 
• 
Enable Monitor Mode: 
• 
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0 
• 
Disable Monitor Mode: 
• 
sudo airmon-ng stop wlan0mon 
• 
Check Current Mode: 
• 
iwconfig wlan0mon 
• 
The output should show Mode: Monitor. 
3. Switching Between Modes 

 
 
 
4 
• 
It’s crucial to switch back to managed mode after completing penetration testing, as 
monitor mode doesn’t allow regular network communications. 
• 
Switching Back: 
• 
sudo ifconfig wlan0mon down 
• 
sudo iwconfig wlan0mon mode managed 
• 
sudo ifconfig wlan0mon up 
Section 1: Understanding Wi-Fi Networks 
1.1 What is a Wi-Fi Network?
