Blind SSRF
Blind Server-Side Request 
Forgery (SSRF) is a 
vulnerability that allows an 
attacker to send crafted 
requests from the server to 
other internal or external 
systems.
Inadequate input validation 
and sanitization, lack of 
proper access controls, and 
trust in user-supplied input 
without proper verification.
Data leakage, unauthorized 
access to internal systems, 
server exploitation, and 
potential compromise of 
sensitive information.
Implement strict input validation and 
sanitization of user-controlled input, utilize 
allowlists for URL whitelisting, enforce proper 
access controls, use network-level restrictions 
to prevent outgoing connections to sensitive 
resources, and employ security tools like Web 
Application Firewalls (WAFs) to detect and 
block SSRF attacks.
88
Time-Based 
Blind SSRF
Time-Based Blind SSRF is a 
variation of SSRF where the 
attacker exploits delays in 
the server's response to 
infer the success or failure of 
SSRF attacks.
Lack of input validation and 
sanitization, server-side 
processing delays that 
indicate successful or 
unsuccessful SSRF requests, 
and reliance on timing-based 
detection mechanisms.
Similar to Blind SSRF, with the 
added risk of increased 
detection difficulty and slower 
exploitation, which may prolong 
the attacker's presence and 
increase the impact of the 
attack.
Implement server-side request timeout 
mechanisms to limit the time spent on 
processing SSRF requests, monitor server 
response times for anomalies, utilize anomaly 
detection tools to identify suspicious behavior, 
and conduct thorough security testing, 
including penetration testing and vulnerability 
scanning, to identify and mitigate SSRF 
vulnerabilities.

MIME Sniffing
MIME sniffing, also known 
as content-type sniffing, 
refers to the behavior of 
some web browsers to 
override the specified MIME 
type of a resource and 
instead infer it from the 
content of the resource.
Lack of proper MIME type 
validation, browsers 
attempting to guess the 
MIME type based on the 
content of the resource.
Potential security risks such as 
content spoofing, XSS attacks, 
and data leakage.
Implement strict MIME type declarations in 
server responses, use the "X-Content-Type-
Options" header with the "nosniff" directive to 
prevent MIME sniffing, validate user-uploaded 
files to ensure they match the expected MIME 
type.
90
X-Content-Type-
Options Bypass
X-Content-Type-Options 
bypass refers to 
vulnerabilities that allow 
attackers to bypass the X-
Content-Type-Options 
header, which is intended to 
prevent MIME type sniffing 
and force the browser to 
respect the declared content 
type.
Improper configuration of the 
X-Content-Type-Options 
header, allowing attackers to 
manipulate or circumvent the 
protection provided by the 
header.
Potential security risks such as 
MIME sniffing, content 
spoofing, XSS attacks, and data 
leakage.
Ensure the X-Content-Type-Options header is 
properly configured with the "nosniff" 
directive, use strong content-type validation 
on the server side, and employ additional 
security mechanisms such as Content Security 
Policy (CSP).
91
Content 
Security Policy 
(CSP) Bypass
Content Security Policy (CSP) 
bypass refers to 
vulnerabilities that allow 
attackers to circumvent or 
evade the protections 
provided by a CSP, which is 
designed to mitigate various 
types of attacks such as XSS 
and data injection.
Improper implementation of 
CSP directives, allowing 
attackers to inject malicious 
scripts or content that 
bypasses the CSP restrictions.
Potential security risks such as 
XSS attacks, data injection, 
unauthorized access to sensitive 
resources, and data exfiltration.
Implement a comprehensive CSP policy with 
strict directives, including proper whitelisting 
of trusted sources, avoiding the use of unsafe 
inline scripts, and regular auditing and testing 
of the CSP configuration for potential 
bypasses.
