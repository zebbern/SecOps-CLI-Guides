Introduction about  Metasploite 
 
 
 
Metasploit is a popular and powerful framework used for penetration testing, 
exploiting vulnerabilities, and security research. It contains a wide range of 
tools and modules for various tasks in the security testing process. Below are 
some of the main components and contents of the Metasploit Framework 
 
 
 
 
History of Metasploite : 
 
 
The Metasploit Framework is a popular open-source tool for developing and 
executing exploits against a target system. It was first developed by HD 
Moore in 2003 as a portable network tool using Perl, and has since evolved 
into a full-featured exploit development platform written in Ruby.

Modules :- 
 
1. Exploit Modules: These modules are used to take advantage of vulnerabilities in 
target systems. Each exploit module is designed for a specific vulnerability in 
software or hardware. 
 
2. Payload Modules: Payloads are the code that is executed after a successful 
exploit. These can range from simple commands to complex shells and reverse 
shells. 
 
 
3. Auxiliary Modules: These modules are used for various tasks other than 
exploitation, such as scanning, fuzzing, DoS (Denial of Service), and 
enumeration. 
 
4. Post-Exploitation Modules: These modules are used after successfully 
exploiting a target, helping gather information, escalate privileges, and maintain 
access. 
 
 
5. Encoders: Used to modify payloads to bypass security mechanisms, like 
antivirus software, by encoding them in different ways. 
 
6. Nops: Used to insert "no-op" (NOP) instructions in the payload to ensure it runs 
successfully, especially when dealing with buffer overflow exploits. 
 
 
7. Evasion: A category used to avoid detection by firewalls, intrusion detection 
systems (IDS), and antivirus software.

Interfaces: 
➢ Metasploite has different interfaces to ease our tasks 
 
1. MSFconsole : 
 
msfconsole is the primary command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the 
Metasploit Framework. It is the most commonly used interface for penetration testers 
and ethical hackers when performing penetration testing, exploiting vulnerabilities, and 
post-exploitation activities.

1. Exploit Module: 
 
 
 
 
 
➢ An exploit executes a sequence of commands that targe a specific 
vulnerability found in a system

• Show Options in Exploits : 
 
 
 
Usage : 
Open 
1.Terminal – msfconsole -q 
2. msf6 – show exploits ( It displays various options ) 
3. msf6 > use exploit/windows/misc/bopup_comm  
msf6 exploit ( windows/misc/bopup_comm ) > show options [ It displays various 
option in this exploit ] 
4. msf6 exploit ( windows/misc/bopup_comm ) > set RHOSTS = 192.168.74.128 
RHOSTS is a remote host , we should type the victim’s ip address
