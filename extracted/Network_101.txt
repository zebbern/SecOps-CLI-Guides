Configuring HTTP Server 
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a foundational protocol used for transmitting data over 
the web. 
1- Adding new Website. 
 
2- Give site name, Path where i save the simple website files. 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
3- In type select http and select IP (your window) and port is 80. 
 
 
 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
4- Let’s check that it is added or not, so as we can see that it is successfully added. 
 
 
5- Now we will make a simple login page  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
6- Now we will allow it that everyone can use it, open the control panel and open the 
window defender firewall. 
 
7- Click on Advance settings 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
8- Now click on inbound Rules and then click new Rule. 
 
9- Click port and then next 
 
 
 
 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
10- Write port 80 
 
11- Allow the connection and next

13- Give the name like here i give http and then click next. 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
 
14- Here we can see that it is done. 
 
 
15- Now we will open it through IP, simply give your window IP like http://192.168.?.?  
 
 
 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
 
 
16- Here i give username and password

CHECKING THE LOGS 
 Open this location and open this file 
 
 Now we check there logs 
Here i get there username and password, port 80.

Configuring HTTPS Server 
HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, used to encrypt data exchanged between a web server and 
a client to ensure privacy and integrity. It uses port 443 by default, as opposed to HTTP, which 
uses port 80. HTTPS is essential for protecting sensitive information like passwords, credit card 
details, and other personal data when transmitted over the web. 
To configure an HTTPS server: 
1. Set up a web server 
2. Install certificate on the server to enable HTTPS. 
3. Ensure port 443 is open on your firewall. 
4. Test the connection by accessing the server using a browser or a tool like curl from 
another machine. 
If the port isn't open, you'll need to configure your firewall to allow traffic on port 443 and then 
test the connection using your Windows machine's IP address. 
Checking port 443 
I will check it in kali that the port is open or not. 
Here through nmap i checked the port 443 with IP (window IP) but the port is filtered. 
 
 
 
 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
Set up a web server 
First we will make a certificate. 
Open the IIS (internet information services manager) and click on Desktop which i highlighted 
(1) and then click on server certificates (2) and then click on open feature (3).  
 
 
Now click on Create Self-Signed Certificate 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
Give any name 
 
 
Certificate is added successfully. 
 
 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
Now i will make a new website, so for that open the IIS (internet information services 
manager), and right click on sites and add website 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
Give name and path below i show about the path, and click type as https, IP, and port is 443, 
and then select the certificate which we created. 
 
 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
About path: 
I created a simple login page in the below location. 
 
 
So the https is added. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
Configuring Firewall to allow traffic on port 443 
Open control panel and then click on window defender firewall. Click on inbound (1), then 
inbound rule (2), then check port (3), and next. 
 
Give 443 in port and next 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
Click Allow the connection and next. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
Click next 
 
Give name like here i give https and then click next. 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
So we can see that the https rule is added. 
 
 
Now if i rechecked the port so it is open, and ssl/http mean https.

SNMP (Simple Network Management 
Protocol) - Port 161 
SNMP is a widely used protocol for network management, allowing devices on a network to be 
monitored, configured, and managed remotely. It operates on port 161 (UDP) for 
communication between network devices, such as routers, switches, and servers, and a 
management station. 
SNMP gathers detailed system information, including network configurations, user accounts, 
shared folders, and overall system data. Network administrators use this information to 
understand and manage system and network configurations effectively. However, if exploited 
by hackers, SNMP can be used to gain critical system information, making it essential to secure 
SNMP access. 
 
1. First i will check my IP , in cmd through ipconfig commond. 
 
2. Ensure Port 161 is Open: 
 We will Check that UDP port 161 is open on the device's firewall. 
 Use tools like nmap to verify that port 161 is open and accessible. 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
 
When nmap reports "open|filtered", it usually indicates that the port might be open but could 
also be filtered by a firewall, making it difficult to definitively state its status. 
3. The snmp-check command did not receive a response from the SNMP service on port 
161 of the target IP address (192.168.?.?), resulting in a timeout. This could indicate that 
the SNMP service is either not running, is configured with different settings, or is being 
blocked by a firewall or network filter. 
 
 
 
 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
4. Now we will first install the snmp services because it is not showing me in services 
option.  
I. 
Open the Setting, then click on system, and then click on view features 
 
II. 
Now search the snmp and checked and next 
 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
III. 
Then click add 
 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
IV. 
Now it is adding 
 
V. 
Added successfully 
 
 
5. Now it is added. 
 
 
 
 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
6. Configuring SNMP 
I. 
Right click on SNMP service and stop it and then click their properties.  
After that click automatic  
 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
II. 
Now go to security section and uncheck the send authentication trap, and then check 
the accept SNMP packets from any host, and then click add and click read only and give 
name like here i give public and then click on add. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
III. 
Now apply, start, and ok 
 
 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
7. Now we will check that the port is open or not. 
 
 
8. The sudo snmp-check 192.168.?.? command is used to perform an SNMP enumeration 
on a target device with the IP address. This command helps in gathering detailed 
information about the device, such as system configuration, network settings, and 
hardware details, using the SNMP protocol. It's commonly used by network 
administrators for monitoring and managing network devices, and by security 
professionals to audit or assess network security.  
 
 
And now we get the system information  

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
Here also we get the information about the network there complete details.

SMB (Server Message Block Protocol) - 
Port 445 
SMB is a network protocol used for sharing files, printers, and other resources between devices on a 
network. It operates over port 445 (TCP) and allows users to access and manage files on remote systems 
as if they were on their local machine. SMB is widely used in Windows environments for network file 
sharing, and it can also be used for inter-process communication (IPC) and printer sharing. 
 
 
1. Create a folder and share it on network 
 
 
 
 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
2. Open and save some files in this folder 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
3. Now open the properties of this folder (SMB-Server) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
4. Click find, and here i click my window, now if someone have my window username and 
password they will access this folder. 
 
 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
5. Click ok 
 
6. Now click on window and give the permissions. 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
7. First click ok (1), and then click on network & sharing center 
 
8. Public network setting 
 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
9. Private network setting, now the folder is shared. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
10. Now we will check that the configuration is correct or not. Open the smbmap 
 
 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
11. Copy 
 
12. Here i give after –u my window user name & after –p give password. So my SMB-Server 
status is read, write, its mean the configuration is ok. 
 
13. Also i checked that the server is added, i checked through  
Sudo snmp-check IP 
 
 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
14. Here i open my vm window and open the network and on this and give the user name 
and password. 
 
15. After giving the username and password, smb server is showed now open. 
 
 
 
 
 

Prepared by: Aamir Sohail 
16. The files are showed, now everyone can access this if they have the username and 
password.
