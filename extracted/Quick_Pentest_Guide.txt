VHOST Enumeration
VHOST enumeration is the process of identifying virtual hosts (VHOSTs) on a 
web server. A virtual host is a method of hosting multiple domain names
on a single web server. Each domain name is associated with a unique IP 
address or port number, and the web server uses this information to route
incoming requests to the appropriate website.

Passive Reconnaissance with Digital Certificates
Digital certificates are primarily used to ensure the security and
authenticity of websites. They help to establish a secure connection
between a user's browser and the website they are trying to access, by
verifying that the website is legitimate and encrypting the data that is
exchanged between the two parties.
Digital certificates can also be used to discover subdomains of a website.
When a certificate is issued for a specific domain, it is typically issued for
that domain and any of its subdomains. Therefore, by searching for
certificates issued to a particular domain, it is possible to discover
subdomains that are associated with that domain.

DNS Enumeration
DNS enumeration, also known as DNS recon, is the process of gathering
information about a domain name system (DNS) infrastructure and its associated 
records. DNS is responsible for translating human-readable domain names (e.g., 
www.example.com) into machine-readable IP
addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1). DNS enumeration involves querying DNS servers to 
obtain various types of DNS records, which can reveal
valuable information about the target domain including hidden or
internal subdomains
The primary purpose of DNS enumeration is to gather intelligence
about a target's DNS infrastructure. It can be used by security
professionals, penetration testers, or malicious actors to identify
potential vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or targets for further
attacks. By gathering information about the target's DNS
infrastructure, an attacker can potentially identify subdomains, mail
servers, or other potential entry points for further attacks

Zone Transfer
Zone transfer is a mechanism in DNS for sharing and synchronizing
DNS database information between servers. Pentesters and hackers
can leverage zone transfer to gather intelligence about a target's DNS
infrastructure. Zone transfers provide a comprehensive list of DNS
records, including subdomains, IP addresses, and mail servers

Scanning 
Host Discovery 
Identifying Live Hosts
Host Discovery is the always the first step in any ethical hacking certification 
exam and in CTFs. It involves enumeration IP addresses of the systems available 
in the test environment
Netdiscover is used to scan for the live hosts on the network
netdiscover -i (network interface name)

Ping scan is used to scan for the live hosts on the network
nmap –sn 192.168.18.1/24
Arp scan is another method to scan for the live hosts on the network
nmap -sn -PR 192.168.18.0-255
To find Ip addressed 
=> arp-scan -l 
=> netdiscover -r 182.14.4.0/24 
Nmap has a vast variety of scans aval. Some of the most
useful scans for host discovery are listed below
nmap -sn -PU 192.168.18.110 //UDP ping scan
nmap -sn -PE 192.168.18.1-255 //ICMP Echo Ping scan
nmap -sn -PM 192.168.18.1-255 //Mask Ping scan (use if ICMP is b
nmap -sn -PP 192.168.18.1-255 //ICMP timestamp scan
nmap -sn -PS 192.168.18.1-255 //tcp syn ping scan
nmap -sn -PO 192.168.18.1-255 //IP protocol scan.use different p
