1.4. Download and Installation Steps 
First of all, Visit the official Burp Suite website. Download the appropriate version 
(Community or Professional). 
 
 
Run the installer and launch Burp Suite. When asked to select a project file and 
configuration, just click Next and then Start Burp to skip this for now. 
 
2. Intercept HTTP traffic with Burp Proxy 
Burp Proxy lets you intercept HTTP requests and responses sent between Burp's browser 
and the target server. This enables you to study how the website behaves when you perform 
different actions. 
2.1. Launch Burp's browser  
Go to the Proxy > Intercept tab.  
Set the intercept toggle to Intercept on. 
 
Click Open Browser. This launches Burp's browser, which is preconfigured to work with 
Burp right out of the box. 
Position the windows so that you can see both Burp and Burp's browser. 
 
 
 

 
6 
 
2.2. Intercept a request 
Using Burp's browser, try to visit https://portswigger.net and observe that the site doesn't 
load. Burp Proxy has intercepted the HTTP request that was issued by the browser before 
it could reach the server. You can see this intercepted request on the Proxy > Intercept tab. 
 
 
 
The request is held here so that you can study it, and even modify it, before forwarding it 
to the target server. 
 
2.3. Forward the request  
Click the Forward button to send the intercepted request. Click Forward again to send any 
subsequent requests that are intercepted, until the page loads in Burp's browser. The 
Forward button sends all the selected requests. 
 
2.4. Switch off interception 
Due to the number of requests browsers typically send, you often won't want to intercept 
every single one of them. Set the intercept toggle to Intercept off. 
 

 
7 
 
 
 
Go back to the browser and confirm that you can now interact with the site as normal. 
 
 
2.5. View the HTTP history 
In Burp, go to the Proxy > HTTP history tab. Here, you can see the history of all HTTP 
traffic that has passed through Burp Proxy, even while intercept was switched off. 
 
Click on any entry in the history to view the raw HTTP request, along with the 
corresponding response from the server. 
 
 
 
This lets you explore the website as normal and study the interactions between Burp's 
browser and the server afterward, which is more convenient in many cases. 
 

 
8 
 
3. Modifying HTTP requests with Burp Proxy 
This enables you to manipulate these requests in ways that the website isn't expecting, in 
order to see how it responds. Using one of our deliberately vulnerable websites, known as 
"labs", you'll see how this can help you identify and exploit real vulnerabilities. 
 
3.1 
 Access the vulnerable website in Burp's browser 
In Burp, go to the Proxy > Intercept tab and make sure interception is switched off. 
Launch Burp's browser and use it to visit the following URL: https://portswigger.net/web-
security/logic-flaws/examples/lab-logic-flaws-excessive-trust-in-client-side-controls 
 
When the page loads, click Access the lab. If prompted, log in to your portswigger.net 
account. After a few seconds, you will see your own instance of a fake shopping website. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
9 
 
3.2 
Log in to your shopping account 
On the shopping website, click My account and log in using the following credentials: 
Username: wiener 
Password: peter 
 
3.3 
 Find something to buy 
Click Home to go back to the home page. Select the option to view the product details for 
the Lightweight "l33t" leather jacket. 
 
3.4 
 Study the add to cart function 
In Burp, go to the Proxy > Intercept tab and switch interception on. In the browser, add the 
leather jacket to your cart to intercept the resulting POST /cart request. 
 
 
 
Study the intercepted request and notice that there is a parameter in the body called price, 
which matches the price of the item in cents. 

 
10 
 
3.5 
Modify the request 
Change the value of the price parameter to 1 and click Forward > Forward all to send the 
modified request to the server, along with any other intercepted requests. 
 
 
Switch interception off again so that any subsequent requests can pass through Burp Proxy 
uninterrupted. 
 
3.6 
Exploit the vulnerability 
In Burp's browser, click the basket icon in the upper-right corner to view your cart. Notice 
that the jacket has been added for just one cent. 
Click the Place order button to purchase the jacket for an extremely reasonable price. 
 
4 Set the target scope 
The target scope tells Burp exactly which URLs and hosts you want to test. This enables 
you to filter out the noise generated by your browser and other sites, so you can focus on 
the traffic that you're interested in. 
4.1  Launch Burp's browser 
Launch Burp's browser and use it to visit the following URL: https://portswigger.net/web-
security/information-disclosure/exploiting/lab-infoleak-in-error-messages 
When the page loads, click Access the lab. If prompted, log in to your portswigger.net 
account. After a few seconds, you will see your own instance of a fake shopping website. 
4.2  Browse the target site 
In the browser, explore the site by clicking on a couple of the product pages. 
 

 
11 
 
4.3 Study the HTTP history 
In Burp, go to the Proxy > HTTP history tab. To make this easier to read, keep clicking the 
header of the leftmost column (#) until the requests are sorted in descending order. This 
way, you can see the most recent requests at the top. 
 
 
Notice that the HTTP history shows details about each request that the browser has made, 
including requests to third-party websites that you're not interested in, such as YouTube 
and Google Analytics. 
 
4.4 Set the target scope 
Go to Target > Site map. In the left-hand panel you can see a list of hosts that your browser 
has interacted with. 
 
Right-click on the node for the target site and click Add to scope.  When prompted in a 
pop-up window, click Yes to exclude out-of-scope traffic. 

 
12 
 
 
 
4.5 Filter HTTP history 
Click on the display filter above the HTTP history and select Show only in-scope items. 
 
 
 
Scroll back through your HTTP history. Notice that it now only shows entries from the 
target website. All other entries have been hidden.  
 
This greatly simplifies the history to only include items you're interested in. If you continue 
to browse the target site, notice that out-of-scope traffic is no longer logged in the site map 
or proxy history. 

 
13 
 
 
 
5 Reissue requests with Burp Repeater 
This lets you study the target website's response to different input without having to 
intercept the request each time. This makes it much simpler to probe for vulnerabilities, or 
confirm ones that were identified by Burp Scanner. 
5.1  Sending a request to Burp Repeater 
The most common way of using Burp Repeater is to send it a request from another of Burp's 
tools. In this example, we'll send a request from the HTTP history in Burp Proxy. 
 
5.2 
Identify an interesting request 
In the previous tutorial, you browsed a fake shopping website.  Notice that each time you 
accessed a product page, the browser sent a GET /product request with a productId query 
parameter. 
                   

 
14 
 
 
 
Let's use Burp Repeater to look at this behavior more closely. 
 
5.3 
Send the request to Burp Repeater 
Right-click on any of the GET /product?productId=[...] requests and select Send to 
Repeater. 
 
 
 
Go to the Repeater tab to see that your request is waiting for you in its own numbered tab. 
 

 
15 
 
5.4 
Send the request and view the response 
Click Send and view the response from the server. You can resend this request as many 
times as you like and the response will be updated each time. 
 
 
 
5.5 
Testing different input with Burp Repeater 
By resending the same request with different input each time, you can identify and confirm 
a variety of input-based vulnerabilities. This is one of the most common tasks you will 
perform during manual testing with Burp Suite. 
 
5.6 
Resend the request with different input 
Change the number in the productId parameter and resend the request.  
 
Try this with a few arbitrary numbers, including a couple of larger ones. 
 

 
16 
 
 
 
5.7 
View the request history 
Use the arrows to step back and forth through the history of requests that you've sent, along 
with their matching responses. The drop-down menu next to each arrow also lets you jump 
to a specific request in the history. 
 
 
 
This is useful for returning to previous requests that you've sent in order to investigate a 
particular input further. 

 
17 
 
Compare the content of the responses, notice that you can successfully request different 
product pages by entering their ID, but receive a Not Found response if the server was 
unable to find a product with the given ID. Now we know how this page is supposed to 
work, we can use Burp Repeater to see how it responds to unexpected input. 
 
 
5.8 
Try sending unexpected input 
The server seemingly expects to receive an integer value via this productId parameter.  Let's 
see what happens if we send a different data type. Send another request where the productId 
is a string of characters. 
 
 
 
 
5.9 
Study the response 
Observe that sending a non-integer productId has caused an exception.  The server has sent 
a verbose error response containing a stack trace. 

 
18 
 
 
 
 
Notice that the response tells you that the website is using the Apache Struts framework - 
it even reveals which version. 
 
 
 
 
6 Run your first scan 
Burp Scanner can be used as both a fully automated scanner and a powerful means of 
augmenting your manual testing workflow. The list of vulnerabilities that Burp Scanner 
can detect is constantly growing. We work closely with our world-class research team to 
make sure that it stays up to speed with the latest techniques for finding both classic bugs 
and newly discovered vulnerabilities alike. 
Scanning a website involves two phases: 

 
19 
 
1. Crawling for content and functionality: Burp Scanner first navigates around the target site, 
closely mirroring the behavior of real users. It catalogs the structure and content of the site, and 
the paths used to navigate it, in order to build a comprehensive map of the site. 
 
2. Auditing for vulnerabilities: The audit phase of a scan involves analyzing the website's 
behavior to identify security vulnerabilities and other issues. Burp Scanner employs a wide 
range of techniques to deliver a high-coverage, accurate audit of the target. 
6.1 
Open the scan launcher 
Go to the Dashboard tab and select new scan. 
 
 
 
The Scan launcher dialog opens. This is where you can adjust various settings to control 
Burp Scanner's behavior. 
6.2 
Enter the URL of the target site 
In the URLs to scan field, enter ginandjuice. shop. If necessary, remove the URL for the 
website that you set as a target scope in the earlier tutorial, Leave all the other settings as 
their default for now. 
 

 
20 
 
 
 
 
6.3 
Configure the scan 
Select Scan configuration. From here, you can fine-tune many aspects of Burp Scanner's 
behavior to suit different use cases and target sites 
 
Make sure that use a preset scan mode is selected and click Lightweight.  The Lightweight 
scan mode is intended to give a very high-level overview of a target as quickly as possible. 
Scans using this mode run for a maximum of 15 minutes. 

 
21 
 
 
 
6.4 
Launch the scan 
Click OK to launch the scan. Burp Scanner begins crawling from the URL you entered in 
the previous step. 
 
Notice that a new task has been added to the Dashboard to represent this scan. You can 
select the task to view more details about its status and what it's currently doing. 

 
22 
 
 
 
6.5 
See the crawl in action 
Go to the Target > Site map tab and notice the new entry for ginandjuice. shop. Expand 
this node to see all of the content that the crawler has managed to discover so far. If you 
wait a few seconds, you'll see the map being updated in real time. 
 
 
 

 
23 
 
6.6 
View the identified issues 
Monitor the scan's status in the Dashboard tab. After a minute or two, the crawl will finish 
and Burp Scanner will begin auditing for vulnerabilities. To monitor the scan for any issues 
it finds, select the scan from the Tasks list. In the main panel, go to the Issues tab. 
 
 
 
 
If you select an issue, you can see an Advisory tab, which contains key information about 
the issue type, including a detailed description and some remediation advice. Next to this 
are several tabs that provide evidence that Burp Scanner found for this issue. This is 
typically a Request and Response but will differ depending on the issue type.
